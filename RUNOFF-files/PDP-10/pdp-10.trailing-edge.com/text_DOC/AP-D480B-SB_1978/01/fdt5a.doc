FORDDT-10 -- Changes from V5(70) to V5A(101)
October 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

FORDDT is an  interactive  FORTRAN  debugger  designed  for  use  with
FORTRAN  version 4 or later.  It provides the user with the ability to
set pauses (i.e.  breakpoints) and display and change the contents  of
variables,  arrays,  etc., with FORTRAN-like commands.  In addition to
these features, when the FORTRAN program is compiled with the  FORTRAN
/DEBUG  switch,  the  user  is able to trace the program line by line,
display  and  modify  FORMAT  statements,  and  have  array  dimension
information automatically provided to FORDDT.

Version 5A is Version 5 fixed by edits 71 to 101 inclusive.

FORTRAN-10 Programmer's Reference Manual (AA-0944E-TB)


1.2  Monitors

FORDDT will run with any  monitor  supported  by  DEC  which  supports
FOROTS.


1.3  Related System Software

The following system software (or later) is required  to  run  Fortran
programs loaded with FORDDT:

     FORTRA 4B
     LINK   2B(436)
     FOROTS 4B
     FORLIB 4B
     COMPIL 22C  loads FORDDT and DDT via the .DEBUG command



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There have been no major external changes to FORDDT.  See the  section
on  Internal  Changes  below  for a description of the edits that have
been made to FORDDT since its last release.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  There is currently a problem with local symbols in that  some
         library  routines may have local symbols which duplicate user
         defined symbols.  This may cause some locals, which the  user
         believes  to  be  unique outside the currently opened program
         unit, to be  reported  as  multiply  defined.   This  may  be
         avoided  by  typing  a  command  string  of  the form '.DEBUG
         programs,%"NOLOCALS"'.

     2.  FORDDT is very sensitive to spaces in command  lines.   If  a
         parameter  is  to  be  specified  for  a command, the command
         identifier must be terminated by a space:  NEXT/L will  evoke
         a  syntax error, while NEXT /L will not.  Note also that if a
         parameter is not specified the command identifier must not be
         followed  by  a blank:  DIMENSION<SPACE><CR><LF> will evoke a
         syntax error message.

     3.  FORDDT does not support overlays.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install, copy FORDDT.REL and FORDDT.HLP from the release tape.   To
rebuild FORDDT, simply assemble FORDDT.MAC.  To rebuild the HeLP file,
run off FDT5A.RNH.  To regenerate this documentation, simply  run  off
FDT5A.RND.   The  control  file B10FDT.CTL builds all of the files for
FORDDT.

See the file FTN5A.FIG for information regarding installation.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The following is a list of all of the edits made to version  5(70)  in
producing version 5A.


#71    SPR-20553  Typing a FORMAT  statement  causes  an  E8  internal
                  error  if  the  program  was  not  compiled with the
                  /DEBUG switch.  Add more informative error  message:
                  areas affected:  FRMSET, ERR41.

#72    SPR-10088  When typing an array, the indexes are not  correctly
                  typed  if and only if there is a high segment symbol
                  table (for example FOROTS is loaded with symbols).

#73    SPR-21818  When typing a COMPLEX item or array, or accepting  a
                  value  for  a  COMPLEX  array, FORDDT doesn't notice
                  that  each  entry  is  two  words  and   messes   up
                  subscripts etc.

#74    SPR-21988  FORDDT  can't  set  break  points  (PAUSE)  in  high
FDT5A.DOC - FORDDT-10                                           Page 4


                  segment   of  a  FORTRAN  program:   routine  CHKADR
                  clobbers (T).

#75    SPR-21910  When  doing  a  START,  program  should  clear   any
                  supplied arguments from the TTY buffer.

#76    SPR-21910  Fix error in ACCEPT routine which causes unnecessary
                  warning  message when exactly 5 (or exactly 10 if in
                  LONG mode) characters are accepted.

#77    SPR-21910  Make THE pause command with no arguments display the
                  pauses.

#100   SPR-none   Prepare FORDDT to run in -20 native mode with TOPS20
                  conditional.

#101   QAR-2171   Fix FORDDT output to use FOROTS correctly after  OTS
                  edit  661:   output  must start with + and clear TTY
                  buffer afterwards.

None.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edits 56 to 70 fix bugs in FORDDT:

56   Accept lower case characters for MODE modifiers.

57   Don't give  "multiply  defined"  error  message  for  symbols  in
     COMMON.  Remember name of array for DIM command.

60   Prevent FDTIER message for array references when /DEBUG switch is
     not used.

61   Prevent FDTRGR message after an error in group typing.

62   Make WHAT command type the section name where the PAUSE label  is
     located.

63   Make  WHAT  command  correctly  type  variable  names  and  array
     references.

64   Don't type extra CRLF between typed out values.

65   Implement comments in command lines (delimiter is !).

66   Fix test for "array bounds exceeded" in DIM command.

67   Fix lower case range check.

70   The REENTER message is not always complete.   Sometimes  it  does
