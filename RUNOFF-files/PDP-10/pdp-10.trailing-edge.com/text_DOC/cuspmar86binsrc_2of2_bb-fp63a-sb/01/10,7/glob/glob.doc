1.0     SUMMARY


        This release of GLOB fixes all known  problems  with
        GLOB.   GLOB  version  5B  is required to generate a
        global cross reference listing for the 6.02 KI10  or
        KL10  monitors.   All  SPRs received prior to 1 July
        1975 are solved by this release.

        This release will run on all supported monitors.  It
        has been tested on 6.02.



2.0     EXTERNAL CHANGES

        This release includes 9 edits:


         Edit #117 - Changes  /H  processor  to  use  HELPER
                     Changes  version definition to standard
                     format

         Edit #120 - Adds defensive code to handle REL files
                     with  no  name  blocks or multiple name
                     blocks

         Edit #121 - Cleans up problem with reinitialization
                     after completing output

         Edit #122 - Makes /X on destination side work

         Edit #123 - Makes /X on source side work

         Edit #124 - Makes GLOB get  length  of  second  and
                     subsequent relocation groups of a block
                     correct

         Edit #125 - Makes  GLOB   handle   block   type   0
                     correctly

         Edit #126 - Allow ASCII text in the .REL file,since
                     that  is  what the .TEXT pseudo-op does
                     in MACRO V50

         Edit #127 - Add support for block type 100(ASSIGN).

3.0     CHANGES IN ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

        GLOB now must be loaded with HELPER (edit #117).
        Thus the Assembly Instructions are:

                        .LOAD GLOB,SYS:HELPER
                        .SSAVE DSK:GLOB



4.0     KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

        GLOB is not prepared for FORTRAN-10 -  it  does  not
        list FORTRAN-10 COMMON block names

0.      SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM GLOB VERSION 5 TO VERSION 5A

        GLOB version  5A  differs  from  version  5  in  the
        following ways:

        (1) It runs approximately 30 times as  fast  as  the
        previous version.  Thanks to David Pensak of Harvard
        University  for  the  changes  that   enables   this
        dramatic improvement.

        (2) GLOB now has a HELP file.

        (3) The use of an illegal switch now results in  the
        message "?illegal switch".

        (4) Several bug fixes.

        GLOB version 5A is being released because change (1)
        is  a  tremendous  benefit to all users, and because
        the other changes are useful as well.

        GLOB version 5A  completely  replaces  all  previous
        versions and runs under all monitors.

        GLOB 5A depends on FUDGE2 version 14(22) (which  has
        been  field image for over six months).  FUDGE files
        produced by earlier versions of FUDGE2 may not  glob
        properly with GLOB version 5A.



1.      NEW FEATURES

1.1     GLOB now has a HELP FILE, GLOB.HLP

1.2     The use of an illegal  switch  now  results  in  the
APPENDIX B - CHANGES FROM VERSION 5 TO 5A             Page 6


        message "?illegal switch".

1.3     GLOB version 5A runs approximately 30 times as  fast
        as the previous version (5).  Thanks to David Pensak
        of  Harvard  University  for  sending  in  the  code
        enabling this dramatic improvement.



2.      BUG FIXES

2.1     HELP  message  now  says  "errorneous"  for  the  /E
        switch.(SPR 10-7569)

2.2     COMMON symbols in FORTRAN IV routines are now listed
        as defined, even if the defining program comes after
        the first reference.(SPR 10-7740)

2.3     GLOB  no  longer  loops  after  finding  a  multiply
        specified   symbol  in  a  FORTRAN  IV  routine.(SPR
        10-7740)

2.4     Now that FUDGE2  has  been  fixed,  GLOB  no  longer
        contains  a  patch  to  throw  away a wasted word in
        indexed files.(SPR 10-6664)

        Note:  the change in FUDGE2 referred to was made  in
        FUDGE2  version  14(22)  except  that  at the user's
        option this change  could  be  assembled  out.   the
        change   is  made  non-optional  in  FUDGE2  version
        15(45).

2.5     GLOB now makes allowance  for  special  block  types
        output for MANTIS.

2.6     GLOB now resets the default devices to 'DSK' and the
        default  output  filename  to  'GLOB.GLB'  for  each
        command line instead of keeping the  same  value  as
        for the previous line.(SPR 10-8218)
