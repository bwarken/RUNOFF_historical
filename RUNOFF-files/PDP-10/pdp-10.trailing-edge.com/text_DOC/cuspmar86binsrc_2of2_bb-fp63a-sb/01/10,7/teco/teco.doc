TECO.DOC -- Changes from V23B(162) to V24(202)
January 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of TECO is intended to support the File  Daemon  facility
available  with  TOPS-10 release 6.03.  In addition, the internal file
handling routines have been modified to handle default  paths,  SFD's,
libraries,   ERSATZ   devices,   and   the   various   path   switches
(/SYS,/NEW,/SCAN) in a consistent and logical manner.  All  bug  fixes
due to SPR's have also been included.

This version fully replaces version 23B.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  File Daemon Support

TECO will now allow editing of files protected via  the  File  Daemon.
The File Daemon bit (<400>) of the file protection is preserved in the
new source file, the .BAK file, and any ???TEC.TMP file created.  Note
that in order to be able to edit files in other areas, the File Daemon
must allow access to the .BAK file and all ???TEC.TMP files,  as  well
as to the source file.


2.2  File Specification Arguments

TECO will now allow ERSATZ devices and SFD's in arguments to the MAKE,
TECO,  ER,  EW,  and  EB  commands,  as  well  as  the "[-]" and "[,]"
constructions.   More  file  specification  syntax  errors   are   now
detected,  and  several new error messages have been added to describe
these errors.


2.3  The EB and TECO Commands

On an EB or TECO command, TECO will now always put the new source file
where your command string specified.  For example,

     .TECO SYS:NOTICE.TXT

will now create a SYS:NOTICE.TXT and SYS:NOTICE.BAK.

If an EB command finds the source file in some area other than the one
TEC24.DOC                                                       Page 5


specified  in  the  command  string (e.g., on LIB:, by scanning up the
directory path on /SCAN, by searching SYS:  on /SYS, etc.), then  TECO
will  read  the  file from the area on which it was found, and write a
new copy into the area specified in the command string.  No .BAK  file
will  be  created in this case, since the original file is still where
TECO found it.

Anytime that TECO finds a file on an area other than the one specified
in the command string, the following warning will be produced:

     %File found in [path]

On an EB command, this is an indication that the copying of  the  file
described  above  is  occuring.   On  an  ER command, this is simply a
warning that the file is  being  read  from  a  path  other  than  the
user-specified one.


2.4  The MAKE Command

TECO will now accept an equal sign in a MAKE command, for example, the
command:

          .MAKE A=B

     is equivelent to:

          .R TECO
          *ERB$EWA$Y$$

     An equal sign in a TECO command will be ignored, so that

          .MAKE A=B

     followed by

          .TECO <crlf>

     will edit file A normally.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiencies have been reported for  23B  and  not  been
corrected in 24:

     1.  ^C REENTER or EX$$ REENTER someitmes results in lost  editing
         or address checks.

     2.  Changing the size of the push  down  list  causes  a  garbage
         collection error (?GCE).

     3.  The value output in the  [nK  CORE]  message  is  not  always
         correct for KI processors.

TECO.DOC -- Changes from V23A to V23B(162)
February 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This  is  a  minor  release  of  TECO  and  is  intended  to   correct
deficiencies  in version 23A.  This version corrects many bugs related
to handling of  sequenced  files,  ERSATZ  devices  and  DECtape.   It
eliminates  several  ILL  MEM  REF  and  ADDRESS  CHECK  problems, and
generates some new error/warning messages.

This version fully replaces version 23A.

BIBLIOGRAPHY:

     Introduction to TECO (Software Notebook 1)
     TECO Program Manual (Software Notebook 7)



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  Search Commands

TECO now accepts lower case FS and FN commands.  It also provides  for
^S match on the first buffer character.


2.2  Line Sequence Number Processing

TECO now generates the warning message  "%  LINE  NUMBER  DETECTED  IN
INPUT  FILE"  if the file contains line sequence numbers (LSN's) and a
/GENLSN or /SUPLSN switch has not been  specified.   After  generating
this  message  TECO will output existing LSN's without change and will
insert 5 spaces and a tab at the beginning of each line which does not
contain  an  LSN.   These  blank  sequence  numbers  may be removed by
passing the file back through TECO using  the  /SUPLSN  switch.   TECO
also recognizes SOS page marks.
TEC23B.DOC                                                      Page 8


                            ***WARNING***

  TECO is a character oriented editor and thus has  inherent  problems
with  LSN's  which  are more closely related to line oriented editors.
Caution should be used when editing files with a mixture of  sequenced
and  unsequenced  lines  without  /SUPLSN  since for a file containing
LSN's all strings of up to five numbers  initiating  a  line  will  be
treated as LSN's on output.  For example where * indicates an LSN:

     12345     will be output as        12345*
     123       will be output as        00123*
     <sp>2     will be output as
               <sp><sp><sp><sp><sp>*<tab><sp>2


2.3  Altmode Conversion

TECO now uses monitor commands TTY  ALTMODE  and  TTY  NO  ALTMODE  to
determine if altmode conversion should take place.


2.4  Error Messages

Two new error messages have been added:

?NNQ No Numeric in Q-Register N.  This will be generated if a %  or  Q
command is issued on a Q-Register which contains text.

?TTL Tag Too Long.  This will be generated if a tag referenced by an O
command is longer than 128 characters.


2.5  Files Outside of User's PPN

TECO now conforms to the documentation in handling  files  outside  of
the  user's  area.  Editing of a file in another PPN (including ERSATZ
devices) by an EB or TECO command will result  in  reading  the  input
file from the specified area and writing the output file to the user's
area.  For example:

          .TECO  SYS:FOO

     will be executed as

          .R TECO
          *ERSYS:FOO$EWFOO$Y$$

     and
          *EBFOO[P,PN]$$

     will be executed as

          *ERFOO[P,PN]$EWFOO$$

The use of EW with a specified device or PPN now operates properly.
TEC23B.DOC                                                      Page 9


2.6  File Specification

TECO's CCL processing has been corrected  to  allow  specification  of
FILE.  (dot) without an extension in a TECO or MAKE command.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiencies have been reported for version 23 and  have
not been corrected in version 23B:

     1.  ^C REENTER or EX$$ REENTER sometimes results in lost  editing
         or address checks.

     2.  Changing the size of the push  down  list  causes  a  garbage
         collection error (?GCE).

     3.  TECO cannot handle magtape with non-standard block size.

     4.  ?FUL is generated if a file on DECtape is open for both input
         and output.

     5.  Output to  device  NUL:   always  results  in  a  superseding
         warning.

     6.  ?COS error is not detected for EB commands.

     7.  The value output in the  [nK  CORE]  message  is  not  always
         correct for KI processors.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

TECO version 23B is  installed  by  use  of  the  batch  control  file
TECO.CTL



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

TECO no longer changes BAK file  protection  to  standard  but  rather
keeps the protection of the input file.

<ALTMODE> terminating a macro now returns  to  the  next  macro  level
rather than reinitializing.

Garbage collection, error processing, and EW code have been  corrected
to prevent ILL MEM REF and ADDRESS CHECK errors.

ET command corrected to suppress case flagging.

HP command sets bit 35 for first line sequence number in the buffer.
TEC23B.DOC                                                     Page 10


CALLI and TTCALL UUO's have been converted to standard format.

Numeric arguments are preserved across carriage return and line feed.

EH and <> commands now use the stack properly, eliminating  the  cause
of several garbage collection errors (?GCE).

Control flag clearing is delayed to the end of EX processing to retain
status if an error occurs during EX processing.

Logic changed to prevent infinite loop if ?EEE error occurs  with  3EH
in affect.

TECO.DOC -- Changes from V23 to V23A
September 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of this release  is  to  add  the  changes  necessary  for
DATE-75.   This  is  an interim release necessary to make TECO DATE-75
compatible.  Another release (TECO 23B)  is  scheduled  for  the  near
future.   This  will  be a full maintenance release, incorporating all
published patches and other known corrections.

This version of TECO runs on all monitors.   It  has  been  tested  on
5.07/6.01.  There are no known dependencies.

TECO is documented in the Software Notebooks.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no changes to the external specifications.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Since adding DATE-75 is the only change to this version, all  reported
bugs  and  deficiencies  still exist.  There are published patches for
most known bugs.  These will be incorporated into TECO 23B which  will
be  released  soon.   The  DOC  file  for version 23B will specify all
corrections made.  If any bugs or deficiencies remain  uncorrected  in
version 23B, they will be listed in the DOC file at that time.

There is one previously unpublished bug still  uncorrected  which  was
discovered  during our testing for DATE-75:  TECO destroys the date on
a file which has a creation date newer than the  current  date.   This
can  only  happen  if  the  wrong  date  is entered when the system is
brought up, the file is TECOed, the date is moved back to the  current
date  and  the  file  is  TECOed  again.  The cure is to TECO the file
again, thereby causing TECO to create a file with a correct date.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are no changes to the installation instructions.
TEC23A.DOC                                                     Page 12


5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Incorporate the DATE-75 revision.

Update the control file, which builds TECO from the  sources,  to  use
LINK-10.
