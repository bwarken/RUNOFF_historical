SYSTAT.DOC -- Changes from V475(261) to V476(323)
January 1983



1.0  SUMMARY

This is primarily a maintenance release of  SYSTAT,  upgraded  to  run
under  7.02  with (or without) KL paging.  This version supersedes all
previous versions of SYSTAT.  



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

SYS E will now report all  characters  received/transmitted/echoed  on
all cpus in the system.  

SYS P has been enhanced to report the statistics of the second port of
a  dual  port  unit.   It will now report on a port even if no I/O has
occurred on that port, and will not  print  garbage  for  second  port
statistics if on a KS10.  

SYS X header will print the crash file name.  

SYS T has been taught about networks, so it  will  print  more  useful
information on dataset lines.  

REEnter command has been fixed as to not print  erroneous  information
upon reentry.  

"CPUn Not Running" messages have been added to reflect  the  state  of
cpus in a multi-cpu enviroment.  

General 50/60 Hertz and >100% problems have been fixed.  



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

SYS X will not take default path ([-]) file specifications.  



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Same as previous release.  



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

SYSTAT has been upgraded to handle KL paging under the  7.02  monitor.
Also  DDB  and  other  offsets  have been fixed to reflect the current
monitor that SYSTAT is running under.  Other changes not  mention  are

SYSTAT.DOC -- Changes from V474(251) to V475(261)
May 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

This is primarily a maintenance release  of  SYSTAT  but  it  includes
edits  to  correctly handle the 7.00 and 7.01 monitor changes.  It has
been tested on the 6.03A, 7.00 and 7.01 monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The /R switch has been removed since it no  longer  is  applicable  to
systems with networks.

Disk DDBs are now only printed in the busy device status if  your  job
is  specified  (i.e.,  SYS .   or  SYS n, where n is your job number).
this is necessary because disk DDBs are now kept  in  the  per-process
job  data area and may be only reliably read for your job.  SYS X will
continue to list the disk DDBs for those jobs in core at the  time  of
the crash.

The SYS F  command  will  now  print  "Private  structure"  for  those
structures that are private.

SYSTAT will now accept constructs of the form [,n], [n,], and [,].

The SYS U command has been added to print user names in all job status
lines.   The  U  switch  is  sticky and may be combined with any other
legal command.  Therefore, constructs of the form "SYS U [10,*]", "SYS
U 1 2 3", etc.  are now legal.

The SYS X command will now accept a full SFD list in  the  crash  file
specification.

The summary line reporting System Uptime, Idle, Lost, and Overhead has
been re-formatted.  In particular, each CPU in the system appears on a
separate line.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The SYS T command will not print information about any network dataset
lines.  Network dataset lines do not use DSCTAB for dataset control so
SYSTAT can no longer just look through  DSCTAB  to  find  all  dataset
lines.   In  order to do this right, SYSTAT would have to look at each
LDB in the system.  Unfortunately, the LDBs were  moved  to  the  high
segment  in  7.00  so  each LDB reference would have to be done with a
PEEK.  We feel that it is not acceptable to do two to  three  thousand
PEEKs  to  get  this  information.   Non-network  dataset  lines  will
continue to be reported correctly.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile with MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, and JOBDAT.UNV on UNV:  and  load
with  HELPER.REL  on  REL:.   Place  SYSTAT.EXE on SYS:  together with
SYSTAT.HLP on HLP.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

252    Implement the U switch to print user names in job status lines.

253    Add CPU STOPCD type to SYS E code.

254    Implement an in-core cache of blocks read  from  a  crash  file
       during   SYS  X.   This  provides  a  significant  decrease  in
       processing the file.  A new assembly parameter NBCSHE,  defines
       the  size  of  the  in-core  cache.   The  default  value is 25
       (decimal) blocks.

255    Really use the EXE directory  to  extract  information  from  a
       crash file.  The new BOOTS (MONBTS) provided with 7.01 does not
       dump pages marked in NXMTAB, causing holes in the file.

256    Re-format output for CPU uptime, idle, etc.  Change default for
       NCPUS to 4.

257    The line number of the CTY may change after a role switch,  use
       GETTAB  to find the CTY.  Similarly, a role switch confused SYS
       X, fix that too.

260    More of edit 253

261    Edit 256 broke the per CPU display for pre-7.00 monitors.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

233    Remove the /R switch since it has never worked with networks.

234    UNI2ND has a new format to indicate  a  drive  is  dual  ported
       across CPUs.  Make the SYS P code know about it.

235    Print disk DDBs in the busy device code iff we  are  reading  a
       crash  file or for a user's own job.  Since the DDBs are now in
       funny space they cannot be reliably read for any  job  but  our
       own.

236    High and dormant high  segs  can  now  have  pointers  to  path
       blocks.  Follow the pointer and print the owner PPN.

237    Print the monitor name on the user's terminal on SYS X commands
       to  give  him  a  chance to abort without waiting for 3 minutes
       while SYSTAT crawls through the disk file.

240    Print "Private structure" in SYS F for private structures.

241    Print %Overhead time in the header.

242    Accept constructs of the form [,] and allow SFDs  in  the  file
       spec for SYS X.

243    Invalidate SY X if job not logged in except  if  controlled  by
       [1,*]

244    Eliminate CPU1 data from SY E when NCPUS=1

245    Remove references to obsolete flag TTYFLG.

246    Insert a space between the job number  and  a  6-digit  project
       number

247    Remove the ^D sent when SYSTAT is run not-logged-in

250    Get current info on PPN of controlling job for SY X.

251    Enhance the message printed by edit 237 to include the date and
       time of the crash and the stopcd name.

previous  versions  and  answers  all  SPR's received before November,
1978.

Edit #

151    SYS OCL did no longer work due to edit 145.

152    Use new format of num tab table starting with monitor load 722.

153    Use new DDB entry DEVJOB starting with load 722.

154    Use the length of a short DDB to calculate the address  of  DDB
       entry DEVFIL.

155    Use  TRMNO.UUO  to  determine  line  numbers  with  non  TOPS10
       monitors.
SYT473.DOC                                                     Page 13


156    The command sequence:

            .ASS DSK LPT
            .SYS /L/X

       resulted in the execution of an illegal UUO.

157    Replace  all  DDB  offsets  by  a  symbol  DV.XXX  to   prevent
       duplication of UUO names.

160    Never use a zero uptime to compute percentages.

161    Disk errors are reported wrong for a crash file.

162    Print system header immediately on a  SYS X  command,  as  this
       saves much time if one looks at the wrong crash.

163    Subtract the size of the monitors high segment  from  the  core
       size when free core is computed.

164    Old support for reading EXE crashes.

166    Add swapping space last message.

167    Increase remote station loop restriction.

170    Typing continue gives a logged in user of  SYSTAT  the  message
       "KJOB".

171    Typing a SYS X command gives the wrong date.

172    The value of UDB offset  UNIXRA  was  changed  in  602  causing
       extended writes and reads column to be wrong.

173    Ignore all packs and structures with:

          1.  zero mount count

          2.  pack not mounted

          3.  pack offline

          4.  zero reads and writes done.

174    Make SYSTAT X give error message for non-disk devices

175    Use universal JOBDAT file

176    Remove system 124 from in-house list;  it's been sold.

177    Make /X give proper time for 50HZ countries

200    Make continuous SYSTATing remember the arguments given  in  the
       command.   The  command  line  is now read into a buffer so the
       command can be reread on each pass through.
SYT473.DOC                                                     Page 14


201    Time calculation @ERRLY1 uses decimal 60 explicitly rather than
       tcksec, thus 50 HZ.  countries get bad times !

202    SYSTAT E tries to determine STOPCD type by following address in
       %SYSPC.   unfortunately this produces an ?Ill mem ref if spying
       since %SYSPC points into high segment of monitor.  Make it do a
       PEEK instead for the running monitor and only print STOPCD name
       for a crashed monitor.

203    This edit changes the routine GETFIL to use FILOP.  to open the
       crash  file  on  a  .SYS  X so that privilege checking for file
       access is done correctly.  Previously a  CHKACC  was  performed
       which  correctly  checked  the  files  protection,  however  it
       doesn't check the UFD protection.  In fact, there is no  CHKACC
       function to see if access to files in a UFD is allowed.  If the
       FILOP.  is not implemented, the former method will be used, and
       only  the  file  protection  will  be  checked  before allowing
       access.

204    Make SYSTAT report "Timesharing is over" when it checks KSYS as
       it does when it reports "Timesharing will end in ...".

205    When doing .SYS F don't print blank structures.

206    Busy device information  on  systats  of  crashed  monitors  is
       incorrect if the DDB format of the crashed monitor is different
       than that of  the  running  monitor.   On  systats  of  crashed
       monitors,  the  monitor version should be gotten from the crash
       file.  Its now gotten from the running monitor  because  it  is
       determined  at  initialization time before we know whether this
       is a .SYS X or a SYSTAT of the running monitor.  Also, for  the
       same reason when determining the disk DDB size and building the
       DDB pointers, the value is  gotten  from  the  running  monitor
       rather than from the crash file.

207    Edit  200 broke the REENTER feature of SYSTAT such that if  you
       typed  REENTER, SYSTAT would continually loop.  This is because
       the input buffer is never cleared after  reading  command  into
       buffer.

210    If paged output is requested, you type ^C as  response  to  the
       prompt,  and  you're  not  logged in, the "KJOB" message is not
       typed.

211    Add statistics report for dual ported RPO4'S

212    Fix short DDB problem.

213    Fix type-ahead problem caused by edit 207's fix to edit 200

214    In RDCMND test for full input buffer

215    Modify edit 203 (use FILOP.  for CRASH.EXE) to  use  privileged
       FILOP.  so [1,2] and JACCT jobs get full access.
SYT473.DOC                                                     Page 15


216    SYS C G job number zeroed out CPU time for the job  giving  the
       wrong  CPU  time  for  the  job  and  increasing  the idle time
       reported by the system.

217    Modify edit 215 such that only 1,2 jobs get access to CRASH.EXE

220    Modify edit 144 such that  not-logged-in  jobs  can't  get  LPT
       (unless 1,2 subjobs)

221    SYS C <args> was doing incremental SYSTATs on  the  repetitions
       of  the  command  line.   Fix it to act like original start up,
       except that command line has already been saved away.

222    Replace edit 217 fix because "SYSTAT O"  sets  FL.GOD  and  any
       random user who used this would get the FILOP.  priv bit.

223    Continuous stuff is done incorrectly for  particular  arguments
       compute  uptime  immediately after command decoding.  Flag once
       through in HACKQ.  don't always do CLRBFI'S.  Undo edit 216, it
       caused outrageous %CPU times with "REENTER"

224    Fix 5.03 or later unit error info routine.   UNI2ND  should  be
       indexed by D.

225    PPN'S must have non-zero project numbers

226    Fix "SY P" to report on  all  the  structures  mounted  on  the
       system,  especially  those beyond a structure data block with a
       null name.

227    If "SYSTAT C" is going to disk, make  it  update  the  file  in
       append mode.

230    Create a subroutine to simulate the CTLJOB UUO when SYSTATing a
       crash file.

231    Not enough bits used to determine active swapping statistics in
       "SYSTAT P".  Used to be 2**12, currently 2**13.

232    1) at GETFIL + 2 use [1,,2] not FSFPPN since the latter is  not
       setup at this point.

       2) at GETFIL + 3 replace 400000 with FO.PRV.

SYSTAT.DOC -- Changes from V471 to V472
June 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

Systat version 472 has been updated to run with 507 and 601  monitors.
In addition to this all know problems have been fixed.  Note that this
version uses a help file.

NOTE:  NO DATE 75 DEPENDENCY



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The V command will give "paged output".  This means that the user  has
to  force  the continuation of SYSTAT by typing random character, this
mode is intended for VT05 type terminals.

The X command accepts currently a file specification, note  that  this
specification  has  to  be separated from the X by either a slash or a
blank.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

SYSTAT currently uses a help file and requires the file HELPER.REL  to
be linked in the low segment.

See file SYSTAT.CTL for explicit instructions.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  Illegal memory reference problem.

     2.  SYS  .....  (many dots).

         No longer gives illegal memory reference or expands SYSTAT.

     3.  The PDB data for crash files is listed correctly.

     4.  SYS LEF no longer produces an empty file.
SYT472.DOC                                                     Page 20


     5.  Before writing the disk  file  SYSTAT.TXT  a  CHKACC  UUO  is
         performed to verify the write privilege.

     6.  Spooled devices are listed with a quote sign in the  operator
         output.

     7.  The amount of swapping space lost will be reported correctly.

     8.  Users will be warned, that no operator is on duty.

     9.  SYSTAT.HLP has been  updated  to  conform  to  the  507 - 601
         monitor.
