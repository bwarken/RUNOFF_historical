1.0	SUMMARY

		TGHA - THE GREAT HEURISTIC ALGORITHM

	TGHA IS THE PROGRAM THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING THE
MF20 MEMORIES IN A VIABLE CONDITION VIA MF20 MAINTAINENCE FEATURES.

1.1	TGHA SOURCES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS.

1.2	NOTE THAT THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES TO BOTH TOPS10 AND TOPS20 UNLESS
OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.


2.0	EXTERNAL CHANGES

	TGHA PHASE 2 HAS SOME ADDITION FEATURES.

2.1	TGHA PHASE 2 WILL NOT INTERRUPT THE SYSTEM ON EVERY CORRECTABLE
ERROR FROM AN MF20.  TGHA PHASE 2 WILL INSTEAD INTERRUPT THE SYSTEM ONLY
WHEN PUTTING OR CHANGING THE USE OF A SPARE BIT.

2.2	TGHA PHASE 2 WILL MAKE SYSERR ENTRIES INDICATING NEW HARD FAILURES.
ALSO, SERIOUS ERRORS WILL BE INDICATED ON THE CTY.

2.3	THE KNOWN ERROR LIST IS NOW SUPPORTED IN THE HISTORY LIST FILE:
TOPS10 - HISTRY.LST
TOPS20 - HISTORY.LST

2.4	IF THE MEMORY BOOT PORTION OF KLI DOES NOT CONFIGURE A BLOCK OF MF20
MEMORY DUE TO A TRIPLE BIT ERROR, TGHA PHASE 2 WILL INDICATE WHAT MEMORY
AND HOW MUCH MEMORY WAS NOT CONFIGURED.  THE MESSAGE WILL APPEAR ON THE
CTY, IN THE TGHA TRACE FILE, AND THE SYSERR FILE.

2.5	IF THERE IS ONLY CORE ON A SYSTEM, TGHA WILL BE RUN BY THE MONITOR,
BUT THE "TGHA IS RUNNING..." MESSAGE WILL NOT APPEAR.  IF THE MF20 IS
INSTALLED, BUT NOT ON LINE, THE MESSAGE WILL APPEAR, AND "NO MF20 FOUND
ON THE SYSTEM" WILL BE ENTERED IN THE TRACE FILE.


3.0	KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

3.1	IF THE MEMORY BOOT PORTION OF KLI FINDS A PARITY ERROR, KLI WILL USE
THE SPARE BIT AND CONFIGURE THE BLOCK.  TGHA PHASE 2, UPON FINDING THAT
A SPARE BIT WAS SET INTO USE BY KLI, WILL NEVER USE THAT SPARE BIT FOR
ANY OTHER PURPOSE.  UPON FINDING SUCH A CONDITION, TGHA PHASE 2 WILL PUT
AN APPROPRIATE MESSAGE IN ON THE CTY, IN THE TRACE FILE, AND IN SYSERR.

3.2	IF A PARITY ERROR EVER OCCURS DURING SWAPPING IN OF A SPARE BIT, THE
SPARE BIT WILL THEN BE FLAGGED AS IF KLI HAD SET THE SPARE BIT INTO USE
(SEE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH).  SIMILAR CTY, TRACE FILE AND SYSERR ENTRIES
WILL BE MADE.

3.3	NOTE: TGHA PHASE 2 WILL NOT SEND THE "TGHA IS RUNNING." MESSAGE ONTO
THE CTY.  THE ONLY REGULAR MESSAGE IS

"TGHA 2(3) RUNNING FIRST TIME."

INDICATING THAT TGHA IS RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MONITOR RELOAD.

3.4	ON TOPS10, VERSION 7.01, THE USE OF THE SPARE BIT IS AFFECTED BY THE
NETWORK.  IF THE NETWORK IS UP, THE MONITOR WILL NOT LET TGHA CHANGE THE
CURRENT USE OF THE SPARE BITS.  ON A SYSTEM WITH A NETWORK, BUT THE
NETWORK IS NOT UP, THE MONITOR WILL, IN THIS CASE, ALLOW TGHA TO CHANGE
THE CURRENT USE OF THE SPARE BITS.
	IN THIS SITUATION, TGHA WILL STILL MAKE KNOWN ERROR ENTRIES IN
THE NORMAL MANNER.  CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL CONSIST OF USING THE ICE
(IGNORE CORRECTABLE ERROR) BITS ONLY.  THE RESON FOR THIS IS THAT THE
MECHANISM FOR CHANGING THE USE OF THE SPARE BIT WILL PUT ALL FRONT ENDS
INTO SECONDARY PROTOCALL.  THE NETWORK INTERFACE ON TOPS10, VERSION
7.01, WILL NOT PROPERLY RECOVER, CRASHING THE NODE.  IF THE SYSTEM IS
STANDALONE OR THE NETWORK NODE IS NOT LOADED, CHANGING THE USE OF THE
SPARE BIT WILL NOT AFFECT THE NETWORK, THEREFORE THE MONITOR WILL ALLOW
TGHA TO TAKE NORMAL CORRECTIVE ACTION.


4.0	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

IF TGHA PHASE 1 HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM, REPLACE
TGHA.EXE WITH TGHA.EXE FOR PHASE 2.  NOTE THAT TGHA PHASE 2 DATA AND
TRACE FILES NAMES ARE NOW TGHAV2.DAT AND TGHAV2.TRA RESPECTIVELY.  THE
OLD FILES TGHA.DAT AND TGHA.TRA ARE NOT USED BY TGHA PHASE 2 AND ARE NO
LONGER OF ANY USE.  THEY SHOULD NOT BE RENAMED TO PRESERVE THE DATABASE.
THE DATABASES FOR PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 ARE NOT COMPATIBLE.
		  ---

4.1	INSTALLATION ON TOPS10

4.1.1	OPR.ATO

FOR TGHA TO RUN PROPERLY ON TOPS10, THE FOLLOWING ENTRY MUST BE MADE
IN OPR.ATO AFTER DAEMON IS STARTED::

:SLOG
:DEF TGHA=
R TGHA

SINCE TGHA MAY MAKES ENTRYS IN THE SYSERR FILE VIA DAEMON, DAEMON MUST
BE RUNNING BEFORE TGHA IS STARTED.

4.1.2	CORE LOCKING

TGHA WILL OCCASIONALLY LOCK ITSELF IN CORE.


5.0	INTERNAL CHANGES

THE MAJOR FEATURES TO BE ADDED IN TGHA PHASE 2 ARE THE KNOWN ERROR
DETERMINATION ALGORITHM AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTION ALGORITHM.  SYSERR
ENTRIES ARE NOW SUPPORTED ALSO ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL CTY NOTATIONS.


6.0	SUGGESTIONS AND AN OVERVIEW OF TGHA PHASE 2

	TGHA IS RUN:

	1)	BY THE MONITOR AT INITIAL SYSTEM START UP
	2)	BY THE MONITOR IN RESPONSE TO MF20 ERRORS
	3)	BY FIELD SERVICE TO OBTAIN LIST FILES

6.1	TGHA FILE REQUIREMENTS

	THE TGHA PHASE 2 FILE SYSTEM FOR BOTH TOPS10 AND TOPS20 INCLUDES
THE FOLLOWING FILES:

FILE		PURPOSE			CREATION MECHANISM
----		-------			-------------------
TGHA.EXE	TGHA EXECUTION FILE	MONITOR TAPE
TGHA.HLP	TGHA HELP FILE		MONITOR TAPE
TGHAV2.DOC	TGHA OVERVIEW FILE	MONITOR TAPE
TGHAV2.DAT	TGHA HISTORY/DATA FILE	TGHA.EXE WHEN FIRST RUN
TGHA.TRA	TGHA TRACE FILE		TGHA.EXE WHEN FIRST RUN
TGHA.BAD	A BAD COPY OF TGHAV2.DAT TGHA.EXE WHEN THE DATABASE GETS
					CONFUSED

TGHA.EXE MUST RESIDE IN THE AREA:
         ----
	TOPS10: [1,4]

	TOPS20: PS:<SYSTEM>

	WHEN THE MONITOR FIRST STARTS UP ON A SYSTEM RELOAD, IT LOOKS
FOR TGHA IN THE APPROPRIATE AREA.  IF IT IS NOT THERE, TGHA CANNOT BE RUN
BY THE MONITOR.  IF TGHA.EXE IS NOT FOUND, THE MONITOR WILL THROW AWAY
THE ERROR DATA THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BY TGHA.  TGHAV2.DAT AND
TGHAV2.TRA WILL BE CREATED AUTOMAGICALLY BY TGHA WHEN NECESSARY.

TGHAV2.DAT IS NOT LIKE THE SYSERR DATA FILE.  TGHAV2.DAT WILL NOT GROW
AS ERRORS ARE INCURRED.  TGHA WILL PURGE OLD DATA AS ITS DATABASES FILL
UP.  THE ONLY WAY THAT TGHAV2.DAT WILL GROW IS IF NEW HARDWARE IS
BROUGHT ON LINE.  IE.  A STORAGE MODULE IS SWAPPED OR A NEW CONTROLLER
IS ADDED TO THE SYSTEM.  TGHA REQUIRES ALL OF ITS HISTORY DATA THAT IT
HAS COLLECTED OVER TIME TO REMAIN INTACT SO THAT IT CAN MAKE AS CORRECT
DECISIONS ABOUT CORRECTIVE ACTION AS POSSIBLE.

***TGHAV2.DAT SHOULD NOT BE DELETED.  IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT HISTORY
INFORMATION.

6.2	INITIAL SYSTEM START UP

	AT INITIAL SYSTEM START UP, THE MONITOR RUNS TGHA IN START UP
MODE.  IN THIS MODE, TGHA WILL FIRST ENABLE SINGLE BIT ERROR REPORTING
THROUGHOUT MF20 MEMORY.  TGHA WILL THEN EITHER BUILD THE HISTORY FILE IF
IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST, OR VERIFY THAT IT KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THE MF20
HARDWARE THAT IS ON LINE.  IF THE HISTORY FILE EXISTS AND NEW MF20
HARDWARE APPEARS, TGHA WILL ADD THIS NEW HARDWARE TO ITS HISTORY FILE.

ONCE THE INITIAL START UP INITIALIZATION IS COMPLETE, TGHA THEN LOOKS
FOR ANY MF20 ERRORS THAT HAVE OCCURED SINCE THE INITIAL SYSTEM START UP.

6.3	MF20 ERRORS

FOR TOPS10, WHEN AN MF20 CORRECTABLE ERROR OCCURS, THE MONITOR WAKES UP
THE SYSTEM TGHA.  UPON THE SYSTEM TGHA.  FOR TOPS20, WHEN AN MF20
CORRECTABLE ERROR OCCURS, THE MONITOR CALLS TGHA WITH A JOB NUMBER OF 0.
TGHA THEN GETS THE DATA FOR THE MF20 ERROR FROM THE MONITOR.  THIS IS
CALLED A CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR.  THEY ARE STORED UP IN A LIST IN THE
HISTORY DATABASE.  THERE IS A SEPARATE CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST FOR EACH
MODULE.

	ONLY WHEN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST IS FULL DOES TGHA GO OFF
AND ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE A KNOWN FROM THIS LIST.

6.4	KNOWN ERROR DETERMINATION

	KNOWN ERROR DETERMINATION IS DONE STATISTICALLY USING THE CHI
SQUARED GOODNESS OF FIT FORMULA.  STARTING WITH THE FIRST CHRONOLOGICAL
ERROR IN THE STORAGE MODULE, THE FORMULA IS USED TO TEST THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ERRORS IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST FOR
EACH TYPE OF POSSIBLE HARDWARE ERROR.
	FOR INSTANCE, THE FIRST HARDWARE FAILURE CONSIDERED IS A FULL
MUX FAILURE.  A TABLE IS BUILT BY SCANNING ALL OF THE OTHER ERRORS IN
THE STORAGE MODULE AND TALLYING ONLY THOSE ERRORS THAT ARE COVERED BY
THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF HARDWARE ERROR BEING CONSIDERED, IN THIS CASE, A
FULL MUX FAILURE.  THE TABLE FOR A FULL MUX FAILURE IS DISTRIBUTED BY
BLOCK AND SUBBLOCK NUMBER.  THIS TRANSLATES INTO A DISTRIBUTION BY CHIP
SINCE THERE ARE 16 CHIPS INVOLVED IN A FULL MUX FAILURE.  IF THE THE
DISTRIBUTION IS EVEN ENOUGH, THE CHI 2'D GOODNESS OF FIT TEST WILL
SUCCEED, AND A KNOWN ERROR IS DECLARED.
	THIS CONTINUES UNTIL EITHER THE HARDWARE ERROR TYPE IS FOUND OR
ALL OF THE ERROR TYPES HAVE BEEN TRIED.
	THE LAST TYPE OF HARDWARE ERROR CONSIDERED IS A CELL ERROR.
IF THERE ARE MORE THAN A MINIMUM NUMBER OF ERRORS OF THE SAME CELL
(TYPICALLY 5), THEN A CELL ERROR IS DECLARED.
	AFTER AN ERROR TYPE HAS BEEN FOUND, ALL OF THE CHRONOLOGICAL
ERRORS THAT ARE INFLUENCED BY THE KNOWN ERROR TYPE ARE ELIMINATED FROM
THE CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST.  THIS PROCEDURE CONTINUES FOR EACH
REMAINING ERROR IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST.

	AFTER THE KNOWN ERROR ROUTINE HAS BEEN RUN, THE CORRECTIVE
ACTION ROUTINE IS CALLED.

6.5	CORRECTIVE ACTION

	THE GOAL OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION ROUTINES IS TO DETERMINE THE
OPTIMUM CORRECTIVE ACTION GIVEN THE CURRENT KNOWN ERRORS.  THIS IS DONE
ON A PER GROUP BASIS.
	FIRST, THE WORST ERROR IN THE GROUP IS FOUND.  THIS IS THE ERROR
THAT AFFECT THE MOST AMOUNT OF MEMORY.  ONCE THE WORST ERROR HAS BEEN
FOUND, THE APPLICABLE SPARE BITS ARE USED TO COVER IT.  IF THERE IS MORE
THAN ONE KNOWN ERROR IN THE GROUP, A SCAN IS DONE TO SET ALL ICE
(INHIBIT CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING) BITS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE WORST
ERROR.  THIS PROCEDURE IS REPEATED UNTIL ALL KNOWN ERRORS FOR THE GROUP
HAVE BEEN ANALYZED.

NOTE:	THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THE PREVIOUS PROCEDURE.  IF THE MEMORY
BOOT PORTION OF KLI HAS (DURING THE DBE SCAN - DOUBLE BIT ERROR) USED A
SPARE BIT TO HANDLE A DOUBLE BIT ERROR, TGHA WILL NOT CHANGE THE USE OF
THAT SPECIFIC SPARE BIT.  IF TGHA WERE TO ATTEMPT TO USE SUCH A SPARE
BIT FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE, THE POSSIBILITY OF PARITY ERRORS RESULTING
WOULD BE TOO GREAT TO RISK.
	ALSO, IF A PARITY ERROR OCCURS DURING THE SETTING OF A SPARE
BIT, TGHA WILL SET THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS ON THAT SPARE BIT AS IF KLI
HAD SET IT.
	ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE PREVIOUS CONDITIONS, APPROPRIATE SYSERR
ENTRIES WILL BE MADE.

6.6	PARITY ERRORS

	PARITY ERRORS ARE HANDLED LIKE PARITY ERRORS ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
IE.  IF THE MONITOR SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUES AFTER THE PARITY ERROR, IT
WILL ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE PAGE OF MEMORY WITH THE PARITY ERROR OFFLINE.
THE MONITOR THEN RUNS TGHA IF THE PAGE WAS SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED.  THE
MONITOR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE PAGE WITH THE PARITY ERROR OFF LINE
IF ,FOR INSTANCE, THE PAGE WAS PART OF THE RESIDENT MONITOR.  TGHA WILL
ENTER PARITY ERRORS IN ITS TRACE FILE, NOT THE HISTORY FILE DATABASE.
TGHA WILL MAKE AN ENTRY IN THE TRACE FILE AND SYSERR INDICATING PHYSICAL
ADDRESS, BLOCK OF MEMORY, AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE 4 STORAGE MODULES
CONTAINING THE ERROR.

6.7	MAKING LIST FILES

************************************************************************
NOTE:
	IN ORDER TO RUN TGHA MANUALLY, THE USER MUST HAVE THE MINIMUM OF
MAINTAINENCE CAPABILITIES AND BE ENABLED.  THIS IS REQUIRED BECAUSE TGHA
LOOKS AT THE MF20 MEMORY TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION.
************************************************************************

	TGHA CAN ALSO BE RUN BY FIELD SERVICE PERSONNEL.  IN THIS MODE,
ON TOPS10, TGHA KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT THE SYSTEM TGHA.  ON TOPS20 TGHA
KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT RUN BY A JOB NUMBER OF 0.  THEREFORE, TGHA DOES NOT
AUTOMATICALLY LOOK FOR MF20 ERRORS.

	TGHA WILL RESPOND WITH A PROMPT OF:

TGHA>
	IF "HELP"<CR> IS TYPED, THE FOLLOWING TEXT WILL BE PRINTED

TGHA HELP - COMMAND	PURPOSE

	EXIT		EXIT FROM TGHA.
	HELP		TYPE THIS TEXT.
	HISTORY		DUMP HISTORY FILE.
	TRACE		DUMP TRACE FILE.

TGHA>

	THE HISTORY AND TRACE DUMP FILES WILL BE CREATED IN THE AREA
FROM WHICH TGHA HAS BEEN RUN.  THEY WILL BE HISTRY.LST FOR TOPS10 AND
HISTORY.LST FOR TOPS20 AND TRACE.LST RESPECTIVELY.  THE HISTORY AND
TRACE DUMP FILES WILL BE CREATED IN THE AREA FROM WHICH TGHA HAS BEEN
RUN.
	THESE FILES ARE LISTABLE VERSIONS OF THE TGHA DATABASE AND THE
TRACE FILE.  ALTHOUGH TGHAV2.TRA MAY LOOK READABLE, REMEMBER THAT IT IS
THE EQUIVALENT OF A RING BUFFER.  IE.  THE OLDEST DATA IS OVER WRITTEN
WHEN THE FILE BECOMES LARGE ENOUGH.  THIS PREVENTS THE TRACE FILE FROM
BECOMING USELESSLY LARGE.  TRACE.LST IS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, THE
OLDEST ENTRIES FIRST.

	WHEN TGHA IS RUN BY FIELD SERVICE, THE ONLY FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE
ARE THE DUMPING OF THE LIST FILES.  NO CHANGES IN THE MEMORY
CONFIGURATION OR THE USE OF THE SPARE BITS CAN BE DONE BY TGHA IN USER
MODE.

 6.8	HISTORY FILE

	THE HISTORY FILE IS MADE UP OF 3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAGES.  THEY
ARE THE DIRECTORY PAGE, GROUP PAGES, AND STORAGE MODULE PAGES.  THE
SEQUENCE STARTS OUT WITH ONE DIRECTORY PAGE.  THIS PAGE CONTAINS
CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF THE MF20'S ON THE SYSTEM.  THE
NEXT PAGE IS A GROUP PAGE FOLLOWED BY FOUR STORAGE MODULE PAGES.  THE
PATTERN OF A GROUP AND FOUR SUCCEEDING STORAGE MODULE PAGES IS REPEATED
FOR EACH GROUP CURRENTLY ON LINE IN MF20'S.  A STORAGE MODULE PAGE FOR
EACH STORAGE MODULE THAT HAS GONE AWAY IS THEN LISTED.

6.8.1	DIRECTORY PAGE

	THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HISTORY FILE CONTAINS THE CURRENT
CONFIGURATION OF THE MF20 MEMORY, INCLUDING THE LOCATION OF EACH STORAGE
MODULE BY SERIAL NUMBER.  NOTE THAT THE SERIAL NUMBER IN THE HISTORY
FILE IS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE STICKER ON THE STORAGE MODULE ITSELF.
	THE LOCATION OF THE STORAGE MODULES IN MF20 MEMORY IS DOCUMENTED
IN THE HISTORY LIST FILE FOR ARCHIVAL AND FIELD SERVICE REASONS.  THE
ERRORS LOGGED IN THE HISTORY FILE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ORIENTATION OF
THE STORAGE MODULES.  IF THEY ARE MOVED, THE ERROR CORRECTIONS IN THE
MF20 MAY HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS.  IF FIELD SERVICE WISHES TO
REPLACE A STORAGE MODULE, THE EXACT LOCATION BY SERIAL NUMBER IS
THEREFORE DOCUMENTED.

6.8.2	GROUP PAGE

THE GROUP PAGE CONTAINS INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THE
GROUP.  THE LAST TIME THE GROUP WAS USED IN THIS CONFIGURATION MAY BE
USEFUL IF GROUPS OF STORAGE MODULES ARE REMOVED AND PUT BACK INTO THE
MEMORY LATER.  THE TIME OF THE LAST CHANGE TO THE GROUP IS USEFUL WHEN
DETERMINING WHERE THE MOST RECENT ERRORS HAVE OCCURED IN THE MF20.

	LET IT BE NOTED HERE THAT THE CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF ERRORS IN
THE HISTORY FILE AND THE ENTRIES IN THE TRACE FILE ARE TAGGED WITH THE
DATE AND TIME.  THIS IS REQUIRED WHEN CORRELATING CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH
MF20.

THE GROUP PAGE ALSO CONTAINS A MAP OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BIT
SUBSTITUTION RAM.  THE BIT SUBSTITUTION RAM IS USED TO DIRECT BIT
REPLACEMENT WITH THE SPARE BIT RAMS.

THE VALUE OF THE SPARE BIT RAM CONTAINS 4 FIELDS THAT HAVE THE FOLLOWING
MEANING:

	FIELD BITS		MEANING
	400		EITHER KLI USED THIS SPARE BIT TO COVER A PARITY
			ERROR OR A PARITY OCCURED DURING A BIT SWAP.

	374		THE OCTAL VALUE OF THE BIT BEING REPLACED *

	2		SET - CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING IS DISABLED
			CLEARED - CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING IS ENABLED

	1		BIT SUB RAM VALUE PARITY BIT

*	TO FIND THE VALUE OF THE BIT BEING REPLACED, THIS FIELD MUST
	BE SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT BY 2 PLACES, AND THE DECIMAL
	EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE OCTAL DIGITS IS THE WORD BIT BEING
	REPLACED.

	BIT SUBSTITUTION RAM EXAMPLES:
	-----------------------------

	VALUE		MEANING
	256		- THE SPARE BIT IS BEING REPLACED IE NOT USED.
			  THE SPARE BIT IS IN DECIMAL BIT POSITION 43
			- CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING IS DISABLED FOR
			  THIS BIT SUB RAM ADDRESS

	255		- THE SPARE BIT IS NOT IN USE (SAME AS PREVIOUS EXAMPLE)
			- CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING IS ENABLED

	652		- THE 400 BIT ON INDICATES THAT THIS USE OF
			  THIS SPARE BIT PREVENTS A PARITY ERROR
			  FROM OCCURING.  TGHA WILL NOT CHANGE THIS
			  VALUE.  THE BITSUB RAM DATA REQUIRES ODD
			  PARITY.  THE 400 BIT IS IN THE TGHA DATABASE
			  ONLY, AND IS NOT USED IN THE ACTUAL BITSWAP
			  PROCESS.

			- BIT 42 (THE PARITY BIT - REFER TO THE MF20.FMT
			  SECTION) OF THE MF20 DATA PATH IS BEING
			  SWAPPED OUT.

	THE ACTUAL SPARE BIT ADDRESS IN SBUS DIAG FUNCTION 7 IS 7 BITS
WIDE.  THE ADDRESS IN THE GROUP PAGE ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY THE LOWER 5 BITS.
THE HIGH ORDER 2 BITS IS THE GROUP NUMBER WITHIN THE CONTROLLER.  THE
GROUP FIELD IS DETERMINED FROM THE GROUP POSITION IN THE MF20
CONTROLLER, AND NOT THE GROUP DATABASE.  THEREFORE THE GROUP PORTION OF
THE FIELD IS NOT, AND INDEED CANNOT BE KEPT WITHIN THE SPARE BIT RAM
ADDRESS TABLE.  THIS PORTION OF THE SBUS DIAG FUNCTION IS FILLED IN AT
EXECUTION TIME.

6.8.3	STORAGE MODULE PAGE

A STORAGE MODULE PAGE CONTAINS INFORMATION RELATING SPECIFICLY TO THE
STORAGE MODULE.  THE SERIAL NUMBER APPEARS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE
STICKER ON THE MODULE ITSELF.  THIS IS CRITICAL FOR FIELD RETURNS, WHICH
REQUIRE THAT THIS PAGE BE ATTACHED TO THE STORAGE MODULE IF IT IS TO BE
RETURNED TO THE FACTORY FOR REPAIRS.  THE LAST TIME THE MODULE WAS USED
CAN BE USEFUL IN TRACKING MODULE SWAPS MADE IN THE MF20 AND FIELD
RETURNS.

	THE KNOWN ERROR LIST CONTAINS THE ERROR INFORMATION RELATED TO
THE KNOWN ERRORS RESOLVED FROM CHRONOLOGICAL ERRORS BY TGHA.  MOST OF
THE INFORMATION IN EACH ENTRY IS USED BY TGHA TO DETERMINE OVERLAP OF
ERRORS.  THIS OVERLAP IS IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING THE OPTIMUM USE OF
THE SPARE BITS.
	THE STORAGE MODULE CHIP LOCATION IS INCLUDED TO FACILITATE
MODULE REPAIR.
	THE TIME OF RESOLUTION OF THE ERROR MAY GIVE AN INDICATION OF
THE RATE OF DETERIORATION OF FAILURE OF THE MODULE.

	THE CURRENT CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR LIST FOR THE STORAGE MODULE WILL
INCLUDE ANY ERRORS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED INTO KNOWN ERRORS YET.
THERE MAY BE INCLUDED IN THIS LIST, ANY SOFT ERRORS THAT HAVE OCCURED.
THESE SOFT ERRORS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE LIST SOMETIME AFTER A MINIMUM
DEFAULT (ABOUT 1 WEEK).

6.8.4	UNUSED STORAGE MODULES

	ANY STORAGE MODULES THAT ARE IN THE TGHA HISTORY FILE, YET ARE
NOT PRESENTLY IN USE THEN FOLLOW IN A SIMILAR MANNER.  THE INCLUSION OF
THE UNUSED STORAGE MODULES IN THE HISTORY FILE IS REQUIRED FOR THE CASE
WHEN FIELD SERVICE HAS REPLACED A STORAGE MODULE, RELOADED THE SYSTEM,
AND WANTS A COPY OF THE HISTORY FILE FOR THAT STORAGE MODULE SO THAT THE
ERROR DATA CAN BE INCLUDED WITH THE MODULE WHEN THE MODULE IS RETURNED
FOR REPAIRS.
	SINCE THESE STORAGE MODULES ARE NO LONGER PART OF ANY CONFIGURED
GROUP, NO GROUP INFORMATION IS GIVEN.	

6.9	TRACE FILE

	THE TRACE FILE CONTAINS DATED ENTRIES INDICATING WHAT CORRECTIVE
ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY TGHA.  IF THE TGHA SOFTWARE RUNS INTO CONFUSION
OR A DATABASE GETS FULL, ENTRIES INTO THE TRACE FILE WILL ALSO REFLECT
THE DIFFICULTY.  SERIOUS MF20 HARDWARE ERRORS WILL ALSO BE ENTERED IN
THE TRACE FILE.

AN EXPLANATION OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF ENTRIES IN THE TRACE FILE FOLLOWS.
 
6.9.1	THIS ENTRY INDICATES THAT A SPARE BIT IS GOING TO BE SWAPPED AS
CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR AN ERROR.

11-Oct-78 15:50:12	 - IN CONTROLLER 10, GROUP 0, VECTOR 3,THE SPARE BIT IS GOING TO BE CHANGED TO 124 (OCTAL).
 

ONCE THE SPARE BIT SWAP HAS COMPLETED, THE RESULTS OF THE BITSWAP ARE
INDICATED.

  11-Oct-78 15:50:12	 - BIT SUBSTITUTION - EVERYTHING COMPLETED NORMALLY

6.9.2	WHEN CORRECTABLE ERROR REPORTING IS DISABLED FOR A SPARE BIT
SUBSTITUTION RAM ADDRESS, THE FOLLOWING ENTRY IS MADE:

11-Oct-78 15:50:13	 - IN CONTROLLER 10, GROUP 0, VECTOR 3, THE ICE BIT IS GOING TO BE SET.

 
6.9.3	A PARITY ERROR IS LOGGED IN THE TRACE FILE AS FOLLOWS:

**********
11-OCT-78 19:20:02
* PARITY ERROR AT ADDRESS 1001475, BLOCK 0
* STORAGE MODULE SERIAL NUMBERS BY FIELD: 0 = 7460209 1 = 7460108 2 = 7460117 3 = 7460200
**********

6.9.4	A SERIOUS MF20 HARDWARE FAILURE IS INDICATED AS FOLLOWS:

************************************************************************
*11-OCT-78 19:20:02
* TGHA HAS TEMPORARILY CORRECTED A SERIOUS MOS MEMORY FAILURE.
*** CALL FIELD SERVICE TO REPORT THIS CONDITION ***
************************************************************************

	THIS MESSAGE ALSO APPEARS ON THE CTY.  ALTHOUGH THE ERROR HAS
BEEN CORRECTED USING THE SPARE BITS, THE PROBABILITY OF A PARITY ERROR
DUE TO FURTHER HARDWARE DEGRADATION HAS RISEN TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE STATE.
THE MF20 DIAGNOSTICS SHOULD BE RUN AND THE OFFENDING STORAGE MODULE
REPLACED.

6.9.5	IF THE MEMORY BOOT PORTION OF KLI USES A SPARE BIT TO PREVENT A
PARITY ERROR, THE FOLLOWING ENTRY WILL BE MADE IN THE TRACE FILE:

*****
5-AUG-79 13:20:29
THE MEMORY BOOT IN KLI HAS USED THE SPARE BIT TO PREVENT A PARITY ERROR.
THIS CONDITION SHOULD BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
CONTROLLER	GROUP	BLOCK	WORD (BITS 33-35)
10		0	1	5
*****

6.9.6	IF KLI HAS NOT CONFIGURED A BLOCK OF MF20 MEMORY BECAUSE OF AN
ERROR THAT CANNOT BE REPAIRED USING THE SPARE BIT, THE BLOCK WILL NOT BE
CONFIGURED.  THIS MESSAGE ALSO APPEARS ON THE CTY.  AN ENTRY WILL BE
MADE IN THE TRACE FILE AS FOLLOWS:

************************************************************************
*5-AUG-79 13:40:51
* THE FOLLOWING BLOCKS ARE MARKED AS BAD
* AND ARE NOT ON LINE:
*  CONTROLLER	GROUP	BLOCK
*	10	1	3
*	10	2	1
* THIS CONSISTS OF 128K OF MEMORY THAT IS OFF LINE.
*** CALL FIELD SERVICE TO REPORT THIS CONDITION ***
************************************************************************

6.9.7	IF TGHA FINDS THAT THERE IS NO DATABASE AND THAT AN MF20
CONTROLLER WAS LAST INITIALIZED BY TGHA, TGHA WILL OUTPUT THE FOLLOWING
MESSAGE:

*****
15-AUG-1979 15:10:20
* MF20 CONTROLLER 10 WAS LAST INITIALIZED BY TGHA AND
* TGHA HAS LOST ITS DATABASE.  REFER TO TRACE OR SYSERR ENTRY
* DOCUMENTATION IN TGHA.DOC FOR FURTHER DETAILS AND RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS.
*****

	IN THIS SITUATION, TGHA CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER ANY SPARE BITS
IN USE WERE SET BY THE MEMORY BOOT IN KLI OR TGHA.  THIS INFORMATION WAS
STORED IN THE TGHA DATABASE, WHICH WENT AWAY FOR SOME REASON.  TGHA MUST
THEREFORE ASSUME THAT ALL SPARE BITS IN USE WERE SET BY KLI TO PREVENT
PARITY ERRORS.  THIS MEANS THAT THESE SPARE BITS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE
FOR CORRECTION OF FURTHER HARDWARE FAILURES IN THE MF20 MEMORY.THIS IS
NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR TGHA TO BE IN, AND WILL NOT RECTIFY ITS SELF
AUTOMATICALLY.
	ALTHOUGH THIS SITUATION IS NOT IMMEDIATELY CRITICAL, IT DEGRADES
THE PERFORMANCE OF TGHA.  THE RECOVERY PROCEDURE CAN BE DEFERRED TO A
CONVENIENT TIME, LIKE A FIELD SERVICE PM OR A SCHEDULED SYSTEM RELOAD.

		***** RECOVERY PROCEDURE *****

	(1)	DELETE TGHAV2.DAT FORM PS:<SYSTEM>

	(2)	BRING THE SYSTEM DOWN

	(3)	RECONFIGURE THE MEMORY SYSTEM BY USING THE 'FORCE'
		OPTION IN THE MEMORY CONFIGURATION PORTION OF KLI.

	(4)	REBOOT THE SYSTEM

	THIS IS THE -ONLY- TIME THAT THE TGHA DATABASE FILE (TGHAV2.DAT)
SHOULD BE EXPLICITELY DELETED.  ALTHOUGH THIS DESTROYS ALL OF THE KNOWN
ERROR HISTORY, THE KNOWN ERRORS WILL BE RESOLVED BY TGHA IN THE SAME
MANNER AS BEFORE.
	THE PROBABILITY OF THIS SITUATION ARISING IS VERY LOW.  THIS
DRASTIC ACTION IS EXPLAINED ONLY TO COVER THIS SITUATION.

6.9.8	THE SOFTWARE STATE OF THE MEMORY INDICATES WHETHER KLI OR TGHA WAS
THE LAST PROGRAM TO MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE BIT SUB RAM.  ALTHOUGH THE
SOFTWARE BITS IN SBUS FUNCTION WERE DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE, CONFLICTS
MADE THEM IMPRACTICAL.  THE INFORMATION IS FLAGGED IN A WORD IN THE
BITSUB RAM INSTEAD OF USING THE SOFTWARE STATE BITS.  IF, WHEN TGHA GOES
TO CHECK THE STATE OF THE SOFTWARE STATE WORD IN THE BITSUB RAM, TGHA
FINDS THAT THE DATA IS NOT OF THE FORMAT THAT EITHER KLI OR TGHA USES,
THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL BE PUT OUT:

*****
17-AUG-1979 13:02:59
IN CONTROLLER 10 THE BITSUB RAM STATE WORD WAS GARBAGE.
ASSUMIMG A DBE SCAN WAS DONE LAST.  SEE TGHA.DOC FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
*****

	THIS IS A VERY STRANGE STATE SINCE THE SPARE BIT SUB RAM ADDRESS
USED FOR THE SOFTWARE STATE WORD IS NOT IN THE ADDRESS SPACE USED FOR
SWAPPING OF MEMORY BITS.  IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MF20 DIAGNOSTICS BE
RUN AT THE NEXT CONVENIENT TIME.

6.10	SYSERR

SYSERR ENTRIES ARE MADE BY TGHA.  THEY HAVE THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

6.10.1	THIS ERROR IS USED TO INDICATE A NEW KNOWN ERROR:

A NEW MF20 KNOWN ERROR HAS BEEN DECLARED. DATA:
STORAGE MODULE SERIAL NUMBER:  838009
BLOCK: 1, SUBBLOCK: 0, BIT IN FIELD (10): 11, ROW: 71, COLUMN: 24, E NUMBER 192, ERROR TYPE: CHIP

6.10.2	A SERIOUS MF20 HARDWARE FAILURE IS INDICATED AS FOLLOWS:

************************************************************************
*11-OCT-78 19:20:02
* TGHA HAS TEMPORARILY CORRECTED A SERIOUS MOS MEMORY FAILURE.
*** CALL FIELD SERVICE TO REPORT THIS CONDITION ***
************************************************************************

	ALTHOUGH THE ERROR HAS BEEN CORRECTED USING THE SPARE BITS,
THE PROBABILITY OF A PARITY ERROR DUE TO FURTHER HARDWARE DEGRADATION
HAS RISEN TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE STATE.  THE MF20 DIAGNOSTICS SHOULD BE
RUN AND THE OFFENDING STORAGE MODULE REPLACED.

6.10.3	IF THE MEMORY BOOT PORTION OF KLI USES A SPARE BIT TO PREVENT
A PARITY ERROR, THE FOLLOWING ENTRY WILL BE MADE IN SYSERR:

*****
5-AUG-79 13:20:29
THE MEMORY BOOT IN KLI HAS USED THE SPARE BIT TO PREVENT A PARITY ERROR.
THIS CONDITION SHOULD BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
CONTROLLER	GROUP	BLOCK	WORD (BITS 33-35)
10		0	1	5
*****

6.10.4	IF KLI HAS NOT CONFIGURED A BLOCK OF MF20 MEMORY BECAUSE OF AN
ERROR THAT CANNOT BE REPAIRED USING THE SPARE BIT, THE BLOCK WILL NOT BE
CONFIGURED.  AN ENTRY WILL BE MADE IN SYSERR FILE AS FOLLOWS:

************************************************************************
*5-AUG-79 13:40:51
* THE FOLLOWING BLOCKS ARE MARKED AS BAD
* AND ARE NOT ON LINE:
*  CONTROLLER	GROUP	BLOCK
*	10	1	3
*	10	2	1
* THIS CONSISTS OF 128K OF MEMORY THAT IS OFF LINE.

6.10.5	IF TGHA FINDS THAT THERE IS NO DATABASE AND THAT AN MF20
CONTROLLER WAS LAST INITIALIZED BY TGHA, TGHA WILL OUTPUT THE FOLLOWING
MESSAGE:

*****
15-AUG-1979 15:10:20
* MF20 CONTROLLER 10 WAS LAST INITIALIZED BY TGHA AND
* TGHA HAS LOST ITS DATABASE.  REFER TO TRACE OR SYSERR ENTRY
* DOCUMENTATION IN TGHA.DOC FOR FURTHER DETAILS AND RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS.
*****

	REFER TO SECTION 6.9.7 FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.

6.10.6	THE SOFTWARE STATE OF THE MEMORY INDICATES WHETHER KLI OR TGHA WAS
THE LAST PROGRAM TO MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE BIT SUB RAM.  ALTHOUGH THE
SOFTWARE BITS IN SBUS FUNCTION WAS DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE, CONFLICTS
MADE THEM IMPRACTICAL.  THE INFORMATION IS FLAGGED IN A WORD IN THE
BITSUB RAM INSTEAD OF USING THE SOFTWARE STATE BITS.  IF, WHEN TGHA GOES
TO CHECK THE STATE OF THE SOFTWARE STATE WORD IN THE BITSUB RAM, TGHA
FINDS THAT THE DATA IS NOT OF THE FORMAT THAT EITHER KLI OR TGHA USES,
THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL BE PUT OUT:

*****
17-AUG-1979 13:02:59
IN CONTROLLER 10 THE BITSUB RAM STATE WORD WAS GARBAGE.
ASSUMIMG A DBE SCAN WAS DONE LAST.  SEE TGHA.DOC FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
*****

	THIS IS A VERY STRANGE STATE SINCE THE SPARE BIT SUB RAM ADDRESS
USED FOR THE SOFTWARE STATE WORD IS NOT IN THE ADDRESS SPACE USED FOR
SWAPPING OF MEMORY BITS.  IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MF20 DIAGNOSTICS BE
RUN AT THE NEXT CONVENIENT TIME.

SF2 & SF1 ARE SOFTWARE FLAGS DO NOT EFFECT THE HARDWARE, NOR DOES THE HARDWARE AFFECT THEM EXCEPT TO CLEAR THEM ON POWER-UP.  THEIR

NOTE: BITS 23-27 ARE ONLY USED DURING SINGLE STEP DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.  THE LEFTMOST 1 BIT SELECTS THE CORRESPONDING MIXER INPUT
      FOR READING DIAGNOSTIC SIGNALS.  IF 23-27 ARE 0 THEN THE DATA RETURNED IS THE SELECTED SM PROM WORD.  NOTE ALSO THAT
      BITS 26-27 ARE USED TO SELECT THE ADDRESS WHICH IS SENT BACK IN THE MOS ADDRESS FIELD.

6.0	READ THE ECC REGISTER ON THE SYN BOARD.
6.1	READ THE SYNDROME BUFFER ON THE SYN BOARD.  THIS FUNCTION IS ALSO NORMALLY USED BY MONITOR.
6.2	SEL DIAG BITS 07-13 IN PLACE OF MOS BITS 36-42, FORCE ZEROS ON 00-35, RUN THRU A CORRECTION PASS, AND RETURN 00-35.
	*** PLEASE NOTE THAT FCN 6.2 RETURNS THE ENTIRE WORD, NOT JUST BITS 7-14. ***
6.3	UNUSED
6.4	WR ECC COMPLEMENT REG IF BIT 15 SET, THEN READ IT BACK.
6.5	WR ECC COMPLEMENT REG IF BIT 15 SET, THEN ENABLE IT TO BE SENT TO MEM IN PLACE OF D36-42 ON NEXT WR TO MEM.
6.6	READ D36-43 MIXER.
6.7	ENABLE LATCHING OF D36-43 MIXER AFTER NEXT WRITE.

					*** MF20 ERROR CORRECTION CODE (ECC) CALCULATION ***

	CALCULATION OF THE ECC IS BASED UPON BIT CHANGES FROM A DATA WORD OF ALL ZEROS.  THE ECC FOR ALL ZEROS IS DEFINED TO BE
11 111 11 (OR 376 AS IT WOULD APPEAR IN BITS 07-13 OF AN SBDIAG FUNC 6.0).  TO CALCULATE WHAT THE ECC SHOULD BE FOR ANY GIVEN WORD:
TAKE EACH "1" BIT FROM THE DATA WORD, GET THE SYNDROME FOR THAT BIT FROM THE TABLE BELOW, AND XOR IT INTO THE PREVIOUS ECC.
INITIALLY THE ECC IS THE ECC FOR A DATA WORD OF ZERO.

	IF THERE ARE MORE ONES THAN ZEROS IN THE WORD THEN DO THE SAME AS ABOVE ONLY APPLY THE SYNDROMES FOR EACH "0" BIT AND USE
THE INITIAL ECC VALUE OF 10 101 11 (256 OCTAL).  NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING RELATION ALWAYS HOLDS:
		ECC(X)=120.XOR.ECC(.NOT.X)
WHICH MEANS THAT THE ECC FOR THE COMPLEMENT OF A WORD DIFFERS FROM THE ECC OF THE WORD BY 120 OCTAL.

					 ***  MF20 ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTION  ***
					 ---------------------------------------------

		   HOW MF20 ERROR CORRECTION WORKS.					AN EXAMPLE OF ERROR CORRECTION.
		   --------------------------------					-------------------------------
									
	WHEN A WRITE IS DONE THE MF20 CALCULATES AN ECC BASED UPON THE		WRITE A 3 TO MEMORY, ASSUME THAT BIT 27 IS STUCK
DATA IT GOT FROM THE CPU.  THE DATA AND THE ECC ARE THEN PUT IN MEMORY. 	HIGH IN MEMORY.  AS SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE
WHEN A READ IS DONE THE MF20 GETS THE DATA AND THE OLD ECC FROM MEMORY. 	THE ECC FOR 3 IS 362, THEREFORE:
IT THEN COMPUTES A NEW ECC ON THE DATA AND XOR'S THE OLD AND NEW ECC'S			3<362> GOES TO MEMORY.
WHICH RESULTS IN A SYNDROME.  OBVIOUSLY IF THERE WAS NO ERROR IN MEMORY 	ON THE READ BIT 27 IS STUCK HIGH SO THAT WE SEE:
THE OLD AND NEW ECC'S WILL BE THE SAME, AND THE SYNDROME WILL BE ZERO			403<362> FROM MEMORY.
SINCE XOR'ING EQUAL VALUES PRODUCES 0.						WE CALCULATE THE NEW ECC:
											374 IS ECC FOR 0 (LESS 43B PAR BIT)
	NOW, WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR IN ONE BIT THE NEW SYNDROME WILL			250 IS SYNDROME FOR BIT 35
DIFFER FROM WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BY A VALUE EQUAL TO THE SYNDROME OF 		244 IS SYNDROME FOR BIT 34
THE BAD BIT.  THUS XOR'ING THE NEW SYNDROME WITH THE OLD ONE FROM MEMORY		210 IS SYNDROME FOR BIT 27
WILL RESULT IN A SYNDROME EQUAL TO THAT OF THE BAD BIT.  THE SYNDROME			--- XOR THE WHOLE MESS TOGETHER
MAPPED TO A BIT WHICH, IN TURN, IS USED TO COMPLEMENT (IE CORRECT) THE			170 IS THE NEW ECC.
BAD BIT.  SEE EXAMPLE ON RIGHT AT TOP.						WE NOW CALCULATE THE SYNDROME:
											360 IS THE OLD ECC (LESS 43B PAR BIT)
	WHEN ONE BIT IS BAD ON A READ THEN, OBVIOUSLY, THE PARITY OF THE		170 IS THE NEW ECC
43-BIT WORD FROM MEMORY WILL BE BAD.  BAD PARITY IS WHAT CAUSES THE MF20		--- XOR
TO RECOGNIZE A CORRECTABLE ERROR.  THE MF20 THEN GOES OFF AND COMPUTES			210 IS THE SYNDROME
THE SYNDROME.  IF THE SYNDROME IS THAT OF ONE OF THE ECC BITS THEN THE		THE HARDWARE MAPS THE SYNDROME TO THE PROPER BIT
MAPPED CORRECTION BIT GOES NOWHERE SINCE WE DON'T SEND THE ECC BACK TO		AND CHANGES THE BIT:
THE CPU.										403 IS DATA FROM MEMORY
											400 IS THE MAPPED BIT
	IF THERE IS NO PARITY ERROR AND THE SYNDROME IS ZERO THEN THERE 		--- XOR
IS NO CORRECTION NECESSARY.  HOWEVER A DOUBLE BIT (UNCORRECTABLE) ERROR 		  3 IS WHAT GOES BACK TO THE CPU.
GIVES GOOD PARITY (SINCE 2 BITS ARE BAD) AND A NONZERO SYNDROME.  THIS		HOCUS-POCUS-PRESTO-CHANGO, THE ERROR IS GONE!
IS HOW AN MF20 RECOGNIZES AN DOUBLE BIT ERROR.	WHEN A DOUBLE BIT ERROR
IS DETECTED THE MF20 SHIPS THE DATA, AS IS, TO THE CPU WHILE FORCING BAD      ----------------------------------------------------

		 SOFTWARE DOUBLE BIT ERROR CORRECTION.				
		 -------------------------------------				  ZERO	    OK	  EVERY THING IS OK.  TAKE DATA
												   AS IT IS.
	WHEN A DOUBLE BIT ERROR OCCURS ALL IS NOT LOST.  WE MAY BE ABLE 	
TO RECOVER THE DATA USING A SOFTWARE ALGORITHM PROVIDED THAT AT LEAST		  ZERO	    BAD	  43-BIT PARITY BIT IS BAD.
ONE OF THE BAD BITS IS A HARD FAILURE. (1) GET THE WORD AND ITS     				   USE THE DATA AS IT IS.

EQUIVALENCE THE MEMORY WORD WITH THE ORIGINAL WORD. (4) IF THE RESULT IS	1,2,4,8,    BAD	  AN ECC BIT IS BAD.  USE THE
ZERO OR HAS MORE THAN 2 BITS SET, PUNT. (5) IF EXACTLY TWO BITS ARE SET 	 16,32		   DATA AS IT IS.
IN THE EQUIVALENCE THEN XOR IT INTO THE ORIGINAL WORD AND YOU'RE DONE.
(6) IF THERE IS ONE BIT SET IN THE EQUIVALENCE THEN GET ITS BIT NUMBER. 	NOT 0 OR    BAD	  A DATA BIT IS BAD.  CORRECT IT
(7) USE THE ORIGINAL SYNDROME TO FIND THE LINE IN THE TABLE ON THE NEXT 	1,2, ETC	   AND SEND BACK CORRECTED WORD.
PAGE WHERE YOU WILL LOOK. (8) FIND THE BIT PAIR CONTAINING THE BIT. (9) 	
IF NOT FOUND, PUNT. (10) CORRECT THE BITS IN THE ORIGINAL WORD INDICATED	  NOT 0	    OK	  THIS IS A NON-CORRECTABLE
BY THE BIT PAIR AND YOU'RE DONE.								   ERROR.  PUT DATA ON XBUS AS
												   IT IS PLUS BAD PARITY.
	THIS ALGORITHM BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED WHEN THE ECC & SPARE ARE
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TOO.  HOWEVER THE ESSENTIAL IDEA REMAINS THE
SAME.  WHILE SOFTWARE CORRECTION OF DOUBLE BIT ERRORS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED
THE BASIC ALGORITHM IS INCLUDED HERE SHOULD THE NEED FOR IT ARISE.

	THIS IS THE TABLE OF SYNDROMES VS. ALL POSSIBLE BIT PAIRS WHICH COULD CAUSE A DOUBLE
BIT ERROR WITH THAT SYNDROME.  THE SYNDROME IS THE OCTAL NUMBER ON THE LEFT.  REMEMBER THAT
IT IS ONLY 6 BITS BUT IS SHOWN ALIGNED AS IT IS IN AN SBUS DIAG FUNCTION 6.1.  ALL THE BIT
PAIRS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A GIVEN SYNDROME ARE ON THE LINE TO THE RIGHT OF THE SYNDROME.
THESE PAIRS ARE DECIMAL KL10 BIT NUMBERS WITH THE LOWER NUMBER OF THE PAIR TO THE LEFT OF THE
COMMA.	THE PAIRS ARE IN ORDER BY THE LOWER NUMBER.  THE TABLE CONTINUES ON THE NEXT PAGE.
