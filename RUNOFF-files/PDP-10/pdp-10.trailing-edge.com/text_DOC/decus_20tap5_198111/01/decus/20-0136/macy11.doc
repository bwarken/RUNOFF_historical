			INTRODUCTION



MACY-11 IS AN ASSEMBLER WHICH OPERATES ON THE PDP-10 AND ASSEMBLES
CODE FOR THE PDP-11.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VARIATIONS LISTED IN
THIS MANUAL, IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE MACRO-11 ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AS
DESCRIBED IN THE PDP-11 MACRO-11 ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION,
PROG. DEPT. MEMO #130-380-004-07
			CHAPTER 2

			OPERATING PROCEDURES


WHILE MACY-11 IS DESIGNED TO BE LANGUAGE COMPATIBLE WITH THE
MACRO-11 LANGUAGE, ITS PDP-10 OPERATING ENVIRONMENT NECESSITATES
A PDP-10 STYLE OPERATING PROCEDURE.

	THE ASSEMBLER MAKES TWO PASSES OVER THE SOURCE, OUTPUTTING
THE BINARY AND LISTING FILES DURING PASS TWO AND APPENDING
A SYMBOL OR CROSS REFERENCE TABLE TO THE LISTING FILE.  PDP-10 MEMORY
IS DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED FOR LARGE SYMBOL TABLE STORAGE AND MACRO
STORAGE.


2.1	LOADING MACY-11

PENDING ITS ACCEPTANCE AS A CUSP ON THE PDP-10 SYSTEM, MACY-11 IS
CALLED BY TYPING:

	RUN MACY11[140,1122]

AS A COMMAND TO THE MONITOR.  SHOULD ANY PROBLEMS ARISE, A BACKUP
COPY IS:  RUN MACY11[140,317].

2.2	INITIAL DIALOGUE

WHEN THE ASSEMBLER IS READY TO ACCEPT THE USER'S COMMAND STRING,
IT TYPES AN ASTERISK.  THE USER MUST NOW TYPE HIS COMMAND STRING
ON THE SAME LINE.

	THE GENERAL FORM OF THE COMMAND STRING IS:

	BINARY OUTPUT, LISTING OUTPUT _ SOURCE INPUT(S)

	EACH INPUT/OUTPUT SPECIFICATION CONSISTS OF THE GROUP:

		DEV:FILNAM.EXT[PROJ.,PROG.]/SWITCH:ARG

	1.	DEV IS:

		DSK	FOR DISK
		PTP	FOR HIGH SPEED PUNCH
		DTAN	FOR DECTAPE N
		MTAN	FOR MAG TAPE N
		TTY	FOR THE USER'S TELETYPE

		IF NOT SPECIFIED, THE DEVICE IS ASSUMED TO BE THE
		DISK.

	2.	FILNAM IS THE FILE NAME OF THE APPROPRIATE FILE.

	3.	EXT	IS THE FILE NAME EXTENSION FOR THAT FILE.
IF IS NOT SPECIFIED, THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE:

		BINARY STRING:	   .OBJ (RELOCATABLE) OR
				   .BIN (ABSOLUTE)
		LISTING STRING:	   .LST
		SOURCE STRING:	   .PAL OR .P11

	4.	[PROJ.,PROG.] IS THE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBER ASSIGNED
FOR THE DISK AREA TO BE USED.  IF NOT SPECIFIED, THE USER'S LOCAL
AREA IS ASSUMED.  ONCE SPECIFIED, THE NUMBER PAIR BECOMES THE
NEW DEFAULT ASSUMPTION FOR THE FOLLOWING FILES.

	5.	SWITCHES ARE SPECIFIED BY PRECEDING EACH WITH A SLASH
CHARACTER.  SWITCH ARGUMENTS ARE PRECEDED BY COLONS.


		/LI	SIMULATE .LIST DIRECTIVE (SEE CHAPTER 3).

		/NL	SIMULATE .NLIST DIRECTIVE (SEE CHAPTER 3).

		/EN	SIMULATE .ENABL DIRECTIVE (SEE CHAPTER 4).

		/DS	SIMULATE .DSABL DIRECTIVE (SEE CHAPTER 4).

		/CRF	APPEND CROSS REFERENCE TABLE TO THE LISTING
FILES (SEE CHAPTER 3).

		/N	SUPPRESS ERROR MESSAGES AND EXPANDED SUMMARY
TO THE TELETYPE.

		/I	OUTPUT BINARY IN IMAGE MODE (ONE BYTE PER
36 BIT PDP-10 WORD).  THIS SWITCH MUST BE USED FOR MIMIC OR TO
PIP DIRECTLY TO PAPER TAPE.

		/P	PACK BINARY OUTPUT.  THIS IS THE DEFAULT
CASE AND THE SWITCH IS NOT NEEDED.

		/CDR	SIMULATE CARD READER INPUT.  THIS IS ACTUALLY
INDEPENDENT OF THE PHYSICAL INPUT DEVICE BUT CAUSES THE ASSEMBLER
TO IGNORE ALL CHARACTERS ON A LINE AFTER THE 72ND.

		/SOL	SEQUENCE OUTPUT LINES (SEE CHAPTER 3).

		/GNS	GENERATE NEW SOURCE (SEE CHAPTER 3).

		/NSQ	SUPPRESS LISTING OF PDP-10 STYLE SEQUENCE NUMBERS.

		/EQ	EQUATE THE FOLLOWING SYMBOLS TO ZERO.  THIS IS
A METHOD FOR INTRODUCING CONDITIONAL ARGUMENTS WITHOUT CREATING
SPECIAL PARAMETER TAPES.  "/EQ:SYM1:SYM2"  IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE
SOURCE STATEMENTS "SYM1=0" AND "SYM2=0".
			CHAPTER 3

			LISTING CONTROL



	THE MACRO-11 LANGUAGE SPECIFIES, FUNCTIONALLY, A SET OF
LISTING CONTROLS.  ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE MACRO-11 LANGUAGE
WILL ACCEPT SOURCE STATEMENTS CONTAINING THESE CONTROLS BUT SPECIFIC
ACTION TAKEN MAY VARY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION.  THIS ENABLES THE
ASSEMBLERS TO HAVE A DEGREE OF FREEDOM WHILE KEEPING THE SOURCE
LANGUAGE COMPATIBLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, A MINI-VERSION MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE
SELECTIVE LISTING CONTROL, BUT IT WOULD NOT FLAG AN ERROR WHEN
LEGITIMATE REQUESTS WERE MADE.

	MACY11 HAS TWO CATEGORIES OF LISTING CONTROLS:  MACRO-11
COMPATIBLE, WHICH MAY BE SPECIFIED EITHER IN SOURCE STATEMENTS OR
IN THE COMMAND STRING, AND A SUPERSET WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE
COMMAND STRING.


	3.1	SOURCE STATEMENT LISTING CONTROL

	LISTINGS ARE CONTROLLED AT SOURCE STATEMENT LEVEL THROUGH
THE USE OF THE .LIST AND .NLIST DIRECTIVES.  THESE ARE COMPLEMENTARY
IN THAT ANY FUNCTION WHICH CAN BE ENABLED BY A .LIST CAN BE DISABLED
BY A .NLIST.  TO REDUCE REDUNDANCY, THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTIONS WILL
EMPHASIZE THE .LIST WHILE IMPLYING THE .NLIST COMPLEMENT.

	THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ALLOWABLE ARGUMENTS FOR THE .LIST
DIRECTIVE ALONG WITH THE DEFAULT SETTINGS (LI FOR .LIST AND NL FOR
.NLIST):

	THE FIRST GROUP CONTROLS INTRA-LINE LISTING.  SUPPRESSION OF
ANY OF THESE WILL CAUSE THE ASSEMBLER TO UTILIZE THE SPACE BY
MOVING THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE OVER.


	SEQ-LI	LIST THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS.  THESE NUMBERS REPRESENT
THE SOURCE LINE NUMBERS AND ARE REPLACED BY THE NESTING LEVEL
IN PARENTHESES FOR GENERATED LINES (MACROS, ETC.).

	LOC-LI	LIST THE VALUE OF THE LOCATION COUNTER.

	BIN-LI	LIST THE BINARY CODE GENERATED BY THE ASSEMBLER.

	SRC-LI	LIST THE SOURCE STATEMENT.  THIS IS INCLUDED PRIMARILY
FOR COMPLETENESS.

	COM-LI	LIST THE COMMENT FIELD.

	BEX-LI	LIST BINARY CODE WHICH REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE LISTING
LINE.  SUPPRESSION OF THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN REDUCING THE
LENGTH OF LISTING REQUIRED FOR LONG .ASCII STRINGS.


	THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS PERTAIN TO ENTIRE STATEMENTS:

	MD -LI	LIST MACRO DEFINITIONS.

	MC -LI	LIST MACRO CALLS.

	ME -NL	LIST MACRO EXPANSIONS.  THE DEFAULT CAUSES THE
EXPANSION TO BE SUPPRESSED IN THE INTEREST OF SUPPLY ECONOMY.  ME
CONTROLS ALL GENERATED TEXT (.MACRO'S, .REPT'S, AND .IRP'S).

CAUTION - DUE TO THEIR DUAL NATURE, .REPT'S AND .IRP'S QUALIFY BOTH
AS DEFINITIONS AND CALLS.  MACY11 TREATS MD AND MC AS A
PAIR IN THESE CASES, SUPPRESSING THE LISTING IF EITHER IS SET.


	CND-LI	LIST CONDITIONALS.  SUPPRESSION CAUSES UNSATISFIED
CONDITIONALS AND ALL CONDITIONAL DIRECTIVES (WHETHER SATISFIED OR
NOT) TO BE NOT LISTED.

	SYM-LI	APPEND A SYMBOL TABLE TO THE LISTING FILE.

	TTM-**	LIST IN TELETYPE FORMAT (ONE COLUMN OF BINARY TO A
LINE, TRUNCATION AFTER 72 COLUMNS).  DEFAULT SETTING IS DETERMINED
BY THE OUTPUT DEVICE SPECIFIED:  ENABLED IF THE PHYSICAL
DEVICE IS TTY AND DISABLED (LINE PRINTER MODE) IN ALL OTHER CASES.

	TOC-NL	LIST A TABLE OF CONTENTS DURING PASS ONE.  THIS
CONSISTS OF THE .SBTTL DIRECTIVES BEING LISTED AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE LISTING FILE.  EACH LINE CONSISTS OF THE LINE NUMBER AND ALL TEXT
TO THE RIGHT OF THE .SBTTL DIRECTIVE.

	LD -NL	LIST LISTING DIRECTIVES.  SPECIFICALLY, THIS CAUSES
ALL .LIST/.NLIST DIRECTIVES WHICH HAVE NO ARGUMENTS TO BE LISTED.
ITS PRIMARY USE IS IN DEBUGGING LISTING CONTROL.
	.LIST AND .NLIST DIRECTIVES WITH NO ARGUMENTS PERFORM AN OVER-
RIDE FUNCTION.  THEY CONTROL A LISTING "LEVEL" WHICH IS
DECREMENTED FOR EACH .NLIST AND INCREMENTED FOR EACH .LIST.  THE
LEVEL COUNT IS USED AS A THREE WAY SWITCH:

	1.	ZERO (INITIAL CONDITION):  NO SPECIAL ACTION.

	2.	LESS THAN ZERO:  UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPRESS THE LISTING
EXCEPT FOR LINES CONTAINING ERRORS.

	3.	GREATER THAN ZERO:  LIST UNCONDITIONALLY.

.LIST/.NLIST ARE NORMALLY PAIRED TO RETURN THE LEVEL COUNT TO ZERO.
THE .NLIST/.LIST SEQUENCE IS USED TO SUPPRESS A RANGE WHICH IS
NORMALLY LISTED, WHILE THE .LIST/.NLIST SEQUENCE IS USED TO
OVER-RIDE A RANGE WHICH IS NORMALLY SUPPRESSED, SUCH AS IN A MACRO
EXPANSION.  THE LEVEL COUNT ALLOWS MACRO EXPANSIONS TO USE THE
LISTING CONTROL AND RETURN IT TO ITS PREVIOUS STATE.
	3.2	COMMAND STRING EQUIVALENTS

	THE COMMAND STRING CONTAINS THE EQUIVALENT OF ALL THE ABOVE
.LIST AND .NLIST FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS SOME THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT
SOURCE LEVEL (AND NOT NECESSARILY AVAILABLE IN OTHER VERSIONS OF
MARCO-11).  INDEED, MANY OF THE SOURCE LEVEL ARGUMENTS ARE OF PRIMARY
INTEREST AT COMMAND STRING LEVEL BUT CAN BE USED IN THE SOURCE
TO MODIFY DEFAULT SETTINGS.

	THE COMMAND STRING EQUIVALENTS OF .LIST AND .NLIST ARE /LI
AND /NL, RESPECTIVELY.  ARGUMENTS ARE SPECIFIED BY PRECEDING THEM
WITH COLONS.  THUS /NL:BEX:CND IS THE EQUIVALENT OF .NLIST  CND,BEX.

	IN ALL CASES, COMMAND STRING SWITCHES OVERRIDE THEIR SOURCE
LEVEL EQUIVALENTS (AS WELL AS PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES IN THE COMMAND
STRING).  EFFECTIVELY, SPECIFICATION OF A FUNCTION IN A COMMAND STRING
WILL CAUSE ALL ITS SOURCE LEVEL EQUIVALENTS (AND THEIR
COMPLEMENTS) TO BE IGNORED.  I.E. /LI:ME WOULD ENABLE THE LISTING
OF MACRO EXPANSIONS AND CAUSE ALL ".LIST/.NLIST ME"  DIRECTIVES
TO BE IGNORED.

	/LI (NO ARGUMENTS) CAUSES EVERYTHING TO BE LISTED, WHILE /NL
SUPPRESSES THE LISTING OF ALL BUT ERROR LINES, THE SYMBOL TABLE, AND
THE CROSS REFERENCE TABLES.
	3.3	OTHER LISTING CONTROLS

	THE FOLLOWING SWITCHES ARE, IN GENERAL, UNIQUE TO MACY11.
THEY ARE SPECIFIED IN THE OUTPUT SIDE OF THE COMMAND STRING BY
PRECEDING THE MNEMONIC BY A SLASH:

	/N	SUPPRESS ERROR MESSAGES TO THE TELETYPE (UNLESS IT IS
ALSO THE LISTING DEVICE).

	/CRF	APPEND A CROSS REFERENCE TABLE TO THE LISTING
FILE.  MACY11 ACCOMPLISHES THIS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:

	1.	THE LISTING FILE IS GENERATED IN THE NORMAL WAY
DURING PASS TWO, USING THE NAME SPECIFIED BY THE USER.

	2.	SIMULTANEOUSLY, A TEMPORARY FILE (XXXCRF.TMP, WHERE
XXX IS THE JOB NUMBER) IS CREATED.  THIS CONTAINS ENCODED CREF
INFORMATION.

	3.	AT THE END OF PASS TWO, THE TEMPORARY FILE IS READ
AND THE CREF INFORMATION IS INTEGRATED INTO THE SYMBOL TABLE.

	4.	THE REFERENCES ARE APPENDED TO THE LISTING FILE.
IF INSUFFICIENT CORE WAS AVAILABLE TO BUILD THE TABLE, THE PROCESS
IS REPEATED.  WHEN THROUGH, THE TEMPORARY FILE IS DELETED.

	THE CROSS REFERENCE TABLE FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:

	1.	THE SYMBOL ITSELF.

	2.	ITS SYMBOL TABLE VALUE, UNLESS .NLIST SYM WAS
SPECIFIED.  THERFOR THE SYMBOL TABLE ITSELF IS ALWAYS PRE-EMPTED.

	3.	ALL REFERENCES TO THE SYMBOL, EXCEPT THAT NO MORE THAN
ONE REFERENCE TO A GIVEN SOURCE LINE WILL BE LISTED.  SYMBOLS IN
GENERATED TEXT ALWAYS REFER TO THE PREVIOUS SOURCE LINE.

	4.	DEFINING OCCURRENCES ARE FLAGGED WITH A "#".

	5.	DESTRUCTIVE REFERENCES ARE FLAGGED WITH A "*".  THESE
ARE DEFINED TO BE ALL SYMBOLS ENCOUNTERED IN OP-CODE FIELDS WHICH
STORE INTO A MEMORY LOCATION OR A REGISTER.  THUS THE FIRST
FIELD OF A JSR, THE SECOND FIELD OF AN ADD, BUT NEITHER OF THE
FIELDS IN A CMP INSTRUCTION.

	6.	AS MANY REFERENCES PER LISTING LINE AS POSSIBLE,
DEPENDING UPON THE "TTM" MODE, ARE USED.  THIS CAN BE INCREASED
BY SUPPRESSING "SYM".
	/SOL	SEQUENCE OUTPUT LINES.  LISTINGS ARE NORMALLY SOURCE
ORIENTED:
	1.	SEQUENCE NUMBERS REFLECT THE SOURCE LINE NUMBER.
	2.	MACRO EXPANSION LINES HAVE THEIR NESTING LEVEL, IN
PARENTHESES, IN THE SEQUENCE NUMBER FIELD.
	3.	LINES CONTAINING NOTHING BUT A FORM FEED ARE NOT
LISTED BUT CAUSE THE SEQUENCE NUMBER TO BE INCREMENTED.
	4.	PAGE NUMBERS REFLECT PHYSICAL INPUT PAGES (INCREMENTED
ONLY UPON ENCOUNTERING A FORM FEED).  PAGES FORCED BY THE ASSEMBLER
HAVE A -N TO REFLECT AN EXTENSION PAGE.  I.E.  IF THE ASSEMBLER HAD
ENCOUNTERED 3 FORM FEEDS AND WAS ON ITS THIRD LISTING PAGE SINCE THE
LAST ONE, IT WOULD BE "PAGE 4-2".

	WHEN /SOL IS SPECIFIED, LISTINGS ARE OUTPUT ORIENTED:
	1.	LISTED LINES HAVE CONSECUTIVE NUMBERS, EXCEPT FOR
BINARY EXTENSIONS.
	2.	PAGE NUMBERS REFLECT THE NUMBER OF PAGES LISTED.


	/GNS	GENERATE A NEW SOURCE.  THIS CAUSES THE LISTING FILE
TO TAKE ON THE APPEARANCE OF A SOURCE FILE.  SPECIFICALLY, IT:

	1.	SUPPRESSES THE LISTING OF HEADERS, ERROR FLAGS, SUMMARY
BLOCKS, AND ANY OTHER OUTPUT OVER WHICH THE USER OTHERWISE WOULD
HAVE NO CONTROL.

	2.	SIMULATES A /NL:SEQ:LOC:BIN:BEX:ME.

	THEREFOR, BY ITSELF, IT RECREATES THE SOURCE FILE.  NORMAL USAGE
WOULD HAVE SUPPLEMENTARY SWITCHES FOLLOWING IT.  I.E. /GNS/NL:MD:MC
/LI:ME WOULD REPLACE MACROS, REPEATS, AND IRPS BY THEIR GENERATED
CODE, /GNS/NL:CND WOULD PURGE CONDITIONALS, AND /GNS/LI:SEQ WOULD
BE AN EXPENSIVE WAY OF CREATING A SEQUENCE NUMBERED LISTING
OF THE SOURCE FILE.
			CHAPTER 4

			ENABLE/DISABLE CONTROL


	AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF DIRECTIVES, MACRO-11
USES ONE COMPLEMENTARY PAIR, .ENABL/.DSABL, WITH ARGUMENTS.  THEIR
COMMAND STRING EQUIVALENTS ARE /EN AND /DS.  THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN COMMAND STRING AND SOURCE STATEMENT SPECIFICATION, AS WELL
AS THEIR ARGUMENT SPECIFICATION, IS THE SAME AS IN LIST/NOLIST.

	FPT	FLOATING POINT TRUNCATION.  ".ENABL FPT" IS
EQUIVALENT TO ".TRUNC" WHILE ".DSABL FPT" IS EQUIVALENT TO ".ROUND".

	ABS	EQUIVALENT TO "/A" OR ".ABS" IN MACX-11.

	NPP	".ENABL NPP" CAUSES SUPPRESSION OF THE OUTPUT OF
THE FOLLOWING CODE, WHILE ".DSABL NPP" CAUSES ITS RESUMPTION.

	ERF	ERROR FLAGS CAN BE SELECTIVELY SUPPRESSED (OR ENABLED)
BY SPECIFYING ERF, DIRECTLY FOLLOWED BY THE SELECTED ERROR CHARACTERS.
"/DS:ERFZM" WOULD CAUSE "M" AND "Z" ERRORS TO BE IGNORED, "/DS:ERF"
WOULD CAUSE ALL ERRORS TO BE IGNORED, AND "/EN:ERFX" WOULD CAUSE
"X" FLAGS (JMP'S WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN BR'S) TO BE FLAGGED.
