                          FLOPPY DISKETTES (RXA:)



        Diskettes  are  block-addressable  devices,  each  of  which
        contains 77 tracks of 26 sectors each.  No file structure is
        defined by the TOPS-10 monitor, although it is possible  for
        a user-mode program to define a file structure.

        Diskettes  may  be  recorded  in  either  single  or  double
        density.   Single  and  double density may not be mixed on a
        single diskette.  Single density diskettes record 64  16-bit
        words  per  sector.   Double  density  diskettes  record 128
        16-bit  words  per  sector.   The  diskette's   density   is
        determined  by  the  monitor during each IN, INPUT, OUT, and
        OUTPUT  UUO,  and  the  file  status  (IO.DEN)  is   updated
        accordingly.   This  allows  your  program  to determine the
        density  of  a  diskette  by  simply  reading  a  block  and
        examining the resultant file status.

        Only 32 bits of each 36-bit  data  word  in  your  program's
        buffer  are  read or written.  Bits 0, 1, 18, and 19 are not
        transferred and are indeterminate.  Bits 2  through  17  are
        transferred first.

        The monitor provides two  basic  addressing  modes  for  the
        diskette.   Your  program specifies which addressing mode is
        used for each IO operation in the file status word.

        In logical addressing mode,  several  physical  sectors  are
        grouped to form a logical block, which is transmitted with a
        single IN, INPUT, OUT, or OUTPUT UUO.   Logical  blocks  are
        numbered sequentially from zero.  Physical track zero is not
        accessible in logical addressing mode because it is reserved
        for  potential  ANSI  standardization.  The physical sectors
        comprising each logical block are not contiguous;  they  are
        assigned   in   such   a  manner  as  to  optimize  hardware
        performance.  The monitor provides  two  logical  addressing
        modes;  one (Logical-11) is compatible with Digital's PDP-11

        software, the other (Logical-8) is compatible with Digital's
        PDP-8 software.  When in Logical-11 mode, 4 (single density)
        or 2 (double density) sectors are  grouped  to  form  a  128
        (36-bit)   word   logical   block.    The   sector-to-sector
        interleave factor is 2;  the track-to-track skew is 6.  When
        in  Logical-8  mode,  3 physical sectors (of either density)
        are grouped to form a 96 (single  density)  or  192  (double
        density) 36-bit word block.  The sector-to-sector interleave
        factor is 3;  the track-to-track skew is 0.  Physical tracks
        74  thru  77 are not available when in Logical-8 mode;  they
        are reserved for use by diagnostics.

        In physical addressing mode, a single sector  of  32  or  64
        36-bit  words  (depending  on  the  diskette's  density)  is
        transmitted by each IN, INPUT,  OUT,  or  OUTPUT  UUO.   All
        sectors,  including  track zero are accessible.  The sectors
        are sequentially numbered starting with zero.

        Note that, except in Logical-11 mode, incorrectly specifying
        the density of a diskette may cause an unintentional address
        check due to the differing buffer sizes.

        Up to two  RX20  controllers  are  supported  per-CPU.   The
        controller  names  are  RXA  and  RXB.   Each controller can
        support up to two RX02 drives.   Thus,  a  system  with  the
        maximum  number  of controllers and drives would include the
        device names RXA0, RXA1, RXB0, and RXB1.

        The diskette hardware provides the ability for  each  sector
        to  be  marked  "deleted" via use of a special "deleted data
        mark" which the hardware can  create  and  detect.   TOPS-10
        allows  your program to create and detect deleted data marks
        by manipulating the diskette's file status word (IO.PAR).  A
        sector  which  is flagged with a deleted data mark may still

                                    1-2
                          FLOPPY DISKETTES (RXA:)


        contain valid data;  the presence of  a  deleted  data  mark
        does  not  alter the capacity of a sector.  Every OUTPUT UUO
        executed with IO.PAR set in the file status word will  cause
        a  deleted  data  mark  to  be written with the data;  every
        OUTPUT UUO executed with IO.PAR clear  in  the  file  status
        word  will  write only the data, and will erase any previous
        deleted data mark.  No Digital operating system makes use of
        deleted data marks.  However, some other vendors use them to
        signify that a sector is available for use.  Programs  which
        write  diskettes for interchange with these vendors will use
        deleted data marks as prescribed by  the  vendor.   Programs
        which  write  diskettes for interchange with Digital systems
        should not write deleted  data  marks.   Note  that  use  of
        deleted   data  marks  as  a  storage  allocation  technique
        requires your program to read a potentially large number  of
        sectors  until  a  deleted  data  mark  is encountered, then
        rewrite the sector with  new  data.   In  contrast,  Digital
        systems  use  a bit table or directory structure to allocate
        storage.  This approach allows a sector to be allocated  for
        new  data  by  simply  checking  the  bit table or directory
        (usually a few sectors in size) without an  exhaustive  scan
        of the disk.

        A floppy diskette may be operated  only  in  buffered  image
        data  mode  (.IOIMG).  The data mode must be specified by an
        OPEN UUO, and preserved during any subsequent  SETSTS  UUOs.
        The  file  status bits (which are read by GETSTS, and set by
        OPEN and SETSTS UUOs) provide additional  control  over  the
        diskette.  The following bits are defined for diskettes:

                IO.DER  Device error.   Set  when  an  error  occurs
                        during   an   IO   operation  which  is  not
                        attributable to media.

                IO.DTE  Data error.  Set when  a  media-attributable
                        error,  such  as  a CRC (data parity) error,
                        occurs during an IO operation.

                IO.BKT  Block number too  large.   Set  when  IO  is
                        attempted  to  a  block  number which is too
                        large for the selected device/density.

                IO.WPS  (Same  as  IO.BOT)  Encodes  the   type   of
                        interleaving  desired  when using logical IO
                        mode.   When  set,  specifies   that   PDP-8
                        compatible  mode  is  desired.   When clear,
                        specifies that  PDP-11  compatible  mode  is
                        desired.   It  is illegal to set IO.WPS when
                        using physical IO mode.

                IO.PAR  Set by the monitor when a deleted data  mark
                        is  encountered  during  an input operation.
                        Cleared by the monitor when a  deleted  data
                        mark  is  not  encountered  during  an input
                        operation.  Set by your program prior to  an
                        output  operation  to  cause  a deleted data
                        mark  to  be  written   with   each   sector
                        transferred.

                IO.DEN  This two-bit field encodes the  density  and
                        addressing  mode  for the diskette.  Setting
                        the  high  order  bit   specifies   physical
                        addressing  mode.   Clearing  the high order
                        bit  specifies  logical   addressing   mode.
                        Setting  the  low order bit specifies double
                        density mode.  Clearing the  low  order  bit
                        specifies single density mode.

                IO.SIM  When set, specifies that  2-sided  media  is
                        present in the drive.  When clear, specifies
                        that 1-sided media  is  present.   Like  the
                        density  bit of IO.DEN, IO.SIM is updated by
                        the monitor during each transfer.  IO.SIM is
                        also used to determine the maximum number of
                        blocks which the device can store.  (2-Sided
                        media    has    twice    the    number    of

        Floppy diskettes respond to the following UUOs.   Except  as
        noted,  the  calling  sequence  is the same as for any other
        device.

        DEVSIZ     Returns the default buffer  size  and  number  of
                   buffers   for   a   given  IO  mode.   To  ensure
                   compatibility with future  releases,  always  use
                   DEVSIZ  when allocating your own buffers.  (Don't
                   "hardwire" buffer sizes.)

        FILOP.     IO functions perform the same  functions  as  the
                   individual UUOs listed here.

        OPEN       Assigns a floppy diskette to a channel.  See  the
                   file  status bits (above).  Note that the initial
                   file  status  bits  specified  by  an  OPEN   UUO
                   determine the size of buffers built by subsequent
                   INBUF, OUTBUF, IN, INPUT, OUT,  or  OUTPUT  UUOs.
                   As  a result, if you plan to use more than one IO
                   mode while a channel is OPEN, it  is  recommended
                   that  you  set  the initial file status to the IO
                   mode wich requires the largest buffer size.  This
                   will ensure that the largest possible buffers are
                   built by the monitor, and will prevent  later  IO
                   from     over-writing     the    buffers'    end.
                   Alternatively, you  can  build  your  own  buffer
                   rings.

        GETSTS     Reads the current file status word.

        IN,INPUT   Reads one block or sector from the diskette.

        OUT,OUTPUT Writes one block or sector to the diskette.

        SETSTS     Sets the current file status word.

        USETI      Specifies which block or sector  is  to  be  read
                   next.    If   USETI   is   not  used,  the  first
                   block/sector read  is  zero.   Subsequent  IN  or
                   INPUT  UUOs  will  read  the  next  consecutively
                   numbered block/sector.

        USETO      Specifies which block or sector is to be  written
                   next.    If   USETO   is   not  used,  the  first
                   block/sector written is zero.  Subsequent OUT  or
                   OUTPUT  UUOs  will  write  the next consecutively
                   numbered block/sector.

        CLOSE      flushes the buffer rings normally.

        RELEAS     Performs a CLOSE (if necessary), then disconnects
                   the channel from the device.

        purchased  for  single  density  use  may  not be usable for
        double-density applications.  After formatting  a  diskette,
        we  strongly  recommend reading the entire disk, and mapping
        any errors.  A format operation takes about  15  seconds  to
        complete,  and  destroys  any  data  previously on the disk.
        Should a power failure, hardware  malfunction,  or  operator
        action  interrupt  a format operation, a diskette may result
        which contains address marks  of  both  densities.   Such  a
        diskette  is  illegal, may result in improper operation, and
        should be reformatted correctly.

        Allows any program to read, and privileged programs  to  set
        the  error  statistics word maintained by the monitor.  This
        word has the format:

                _0___________________17_18___________________35_
                |Number of hard errors | Number of soft errors !
                ------------------------------------------------

        The monitor increments the number of soft  errors  once  for
        each  IO  operation  which  did  not  succeed  on  the first
        attempt, but did succeed during  monitor-initiated  retries.
        The  monitor  increments  the number of hard errors once for
        each IO operation  which  was  not  successful,  even  after
        retrys.   A  given  error  is either a hard error, or a soft
        error;  no error is counted twice.

        The error counter may be of use to a program which wishes to
        move  data  from  a  sector which has a large number of soft
        errors to a new sector, before the original  sector  becomes
        unreadable.  A program may also wish to inform the user when
        a diskette should be replaced.

        If a nonprivileged program wishes to use  error  information
        based  only on its use of a diskette, it must read the error
        counter  when  it  starts  operation,  and  again  when   it
        finishes.   The  difference  between the two values reflects
        that program's use.  Privileged programs  may  simply  clear
        the error counter when they start.  The distributed software
        never resets the error counter, and the monitor makes no use
        of  the statistics accumulated.  However, some installations
        may reset the error counter on a MOUNT command, and log  the
        value  on  DISMOUNT  in  order  to  maintain  a record of an
        individual floppy's performance.
