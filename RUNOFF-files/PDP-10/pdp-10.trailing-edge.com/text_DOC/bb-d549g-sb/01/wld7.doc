WILD.DOC -- Changes from version 6 to 7
September, 1974

Copyright 1974, Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.





1.0 SUMMARY

1.1    This release supports the SCAN guide words of  'AND',
       'OR', and 'NOT'.  'OR' take the replacement of "+" in
       previous versions for DIRECT and  QUEUE.   "+"  still
       works  for  this  version, but will be changed in the
       next version to mean only its traditional meaning  of
       file  concatenation.   The previous version fixed all
       SPRs received through April 25, 1974 (10-13045);   no
       SPRs have been received since then.

1.2    WILD version 7 runs on all  monitors.   It  has  been
       tested  on  6.01.   There  are no known deficiencies.
       WILD fully supports the DATE-75 project.

1.3    WILD version 7 is  documented  in  the  specification
       WILD.RNO.   Also,  it is documented implicitly in the
       software notebook description of DIRECT, and  briefly
       in   chapter   one  of  the  system  command  manual.
       Supporting documentation can be  found  in  the  .DOC
       files for SCAN version 7 and DIRECT version 3.

1.4    Function of WILD
       WILD is designed to be used as  a  subroutine  called
       from  any  program  which  needs to perform wild-card
       lookups on any device.  It is needed since the  logic
       for  selecting  and  reading  directories  has become
       quite involved under the 5-series monitor.  Among the
       special cases handled correctly by WILD and few other
       user-mode programs are  sub-file  directories,  NEW:,
       HLP:, SYSA:, and controller controller-class and file
       structure  abbreviations.   Most   Digital   supplied
       utilities will eventually be converted to use WILD if
       they perform wild-card operations.

2.0    CHANGES

300    Support the file specification separator guide  words
       of 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT' as passed from SCAN version
       7.  Of these, 'OR' has lower precedence, and 'NOT' is
       interpretted  as though it were "AND NOT".  A file is
       selected only if it meets the constraints of  one  of
       the  sets  separated by 'OR'.  Within such a set, all
       matches  must  be  met  including  switches  such  as
       /BEFORE   and   /LENGTH.    'NOT'   is   interpretted
       essentially as an exclusion, i.e., as though the user
       said "ALL x EXCEPT y".

301    Default to /OKPROTECTION if there are any wild cards.
       This  will tend to hide protected files from the user
       in order to not confuse him.

302    If the input side has more wild cards than the output
       side, give the message ?WLDTWC TOO MANY WILD-CARDS ON
       INPUT FOR OUTPUT.  This  means  that  the  user  must
       specify  the  same  number of wild-cards on input and
       output.

303    Whenever the user gives a device name  which  implies
       more  than one structure, ignore any structures which
       are single access by other jobs than the user's.

304    Issue a new warning message if all files  which  were
       found  (or  all directories) had protection failures.
       The message is %WLDAFP ALL FILES PROTECTED file-spec.

305    Issue a new warning message if all files  which  were
       found were rejected either by such switches as /SINCE
       or by the logical conditions introduced by edit  300.
       The   message   is  %WLDAFR  ALL  FILES  REJECTED  BY
       CONDITIONS file-spec.

306    (SPR 10-13,944) Correct typo in  one  of  the  LOOKUP
       error messages.

307    (QAR 2760) Add error message %WLDSDP SOME DIRECTORIES
       PROTECTED which indicates that the file was not found
       in  any  directories  looked  at,  but  some  of  the
       directories  which  matched  the spec where protected
       against the user.

310    (QAR 2836) Correct a bug introduced in edit 304.

311    Add message %WLDSFP SOME FILES PROTECTED  which  will
       be  issued if some files match and also some files or
       directories which might have  matched  could  not  be
       accessed.   This  message  can be suppressed with the
       switch /OKNONE, which suppresses all of  the  summary
       warning messages.

3.0    KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

       None.










4.0    CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       The dummy low-segment file WILDDM  has  been  removed
       since  LINK-10  version 2 (released on the July, 1974
       distribution tape) has a switch /ONLY:LOW  which  can
       achieve  the  same effect and ensures the correct low
       segment  is  included.   Thus,  all  commands   which
       reference WILDDM should be changed to WILD/ONLY:LOW.

       Note that although there are several  programs  which
       use  WILD  and  SCAN, we will not necessarily rebuild
       all of them when WILD is  released.   Typically,  the
       various  utilities  such as DIRECT and QUEUE and DUMP
       will be rebuilt, but major products such as LINK  and
       FORTRAN will not be rebuilt until their next release.
       If the  customer  wishes  to  rebuild,  he  may,  but
       usually  the  changes to WILD and SCAN do not warrent
       the cost of rebuilding and testing.










5.0    SUGGESTIONS

       Read the directories via super USETI if possible  for
       better  speed.   This  would  also allow a pack to be
       read when not mounted as a structure.

       Support a switch to control SFD  scanning,  going  to
       LIB:   and  SYS:.   This  would  override  the  job's
       default.

       When user specifies "SYS:"  and  has  NEW:   enabled,
       wild-card over both [1,4] and [1,5].

       Make the routine which outputs "IN USE BY JOB  n"  be
WILD.DOC -- Changes from version 6 to 7               Page 4


       generally available.

       Extend the error message routines to include all  the
       components of a concatenated specification.

       Include /BEFORE, etc., in the error message "NO  SUCH
       FILE  AS"  since  the  file may exist, but it is just
       excluded by the constraints.

       Expand the search logic  to  allow  concatenation  of
       directories which are different (SPR 10-9943).

       (SPR 10-10209) Add switches to control the start  and
       end of files which match a wild-card.  Thus, the user
       could "restart"  on  a  specified  file.   Also,  add
       switches  which specify to skip n files and then do m
       files.

       (SPR 10-102019) Add a  switch  to  do  the  files  in
       reverse  order.  This would catch recent files before
       older ones.

       (SPR 10-13457) Allow the caller to specify a  channel
       which  can  be  kept  OPEN  in  order to speed up the
       processing.

143    Remove a bug which caused  [p,pn,*,*,*]  and  similar
       constructions   to   not   work  as  intended.   This
       construction will now correctly find all files.

144    Correct a  bug  in  the  handling  of  wild-cards  on
       DECtapes.

145    As a performance  improvement,  especially  for  KJOB
       calling of QUEUE, delete directory access tables only
       if the directory does not belong to the user.

146    Add the capability for the caller to obtain a list of
       structures which match the user specified device.  In
       particular, "SYS" will return  the  sys-search  list;
       "ALL"  will  return  the all-search list;  "DPA" will
       return all structures on RP10 number 0;  etc.   There
       are  two  new  entry  points, .INSTR and .NXSTR.  The
       first initializes  the  proceedure  with  the  user's
       device  and  the  /PHYSICAL switch if specified;  and
       skip returns with a code to indicate whether multiple
       structures  may  be  involved.   The  second takes no
       argument and returns the name of the next  structure,
       or    0    when    done.     These    routines    are
       self-initializing, but can not be used  while  .LKWLD
       is in progress.

147    Convert to use  C.MAC  and  SCNMAC.MAC  as  universal
       files.

150    Support  the  user  specified  /MESSAGE  level   from
       .GTWCH.   This  allows  the user to obtain either the
       error prefix, or the message, or both.

151    Move the routine .PTWRD to .SCAN.

152    Support /MESSAGE switch from SCAN.

153    (SPR 10-12368) Handle UFD names when they occur as  a
       file (not as SIXBIT).

154    Fix /STR with  non-wild  names  to  use  the  correct
       directory  (if  device  forces  it)  and to issue the
       correct messages if the file or directory is missing.

155    If /OKNONE is given, then no error will be listed  if
       the  file  is missing.  This extends the influence of
       the switch to non-wild environments as well  as  wild
       ones.
WILD.DOC -- changes from version 5 to 6               Page 6


156    (SPR  10-12368)  Support  the  switches  /BEFORE  and
       /SINCE on DEC-tapes.

157    Add an optional argument to  .LKWLD  to  specify  the
       address   of  a  routine  to  call  whenever  end  of
       directory is reached.   This  will  allow  DIRECT  to
       issue its summaries more rapidly.

160    Add an option bit to cause SFD scanning down to occur
       at  the end of the owning directory instead of in the
       middle.  This necessitates  a  second  pass  for  any
       directory  containing  an  SFD,  but allows DIRECT to
       give a  cleaner  listing  when  multiple  levels  are
       specified.

161    Support  the  switches  /ABEFORE,  /ASINCE,  /LENGTH,
       /ESTIMATE, /ERSUPERSEDE, and /VERSION.

162    (QAR 1882) More of edit 153.

163    More of edit 161.  Also, clean up the handling of the
       special error code inserts.

164    More of edit 161.

165    Correct NUL:  handling in 135.

2.0    CHANGES

123    Add a new error message "?  NO FILE NAME SPECIFIED".

124    Add routine .SCWLD  to  handle  secondary  wild-cards
       such as output files.

125    Simplify checks for end of directory list.

126    At location WILDK, replace the HALT with  a  JRST  to
       recover from read errors in the directory.

127    Add routines E.LKEN and  .TFILB  as  general  purpose
       SCAN style typeout blocks.

130    Create a dummy module, WILDDM, which  defines  a  low
       segment the same size as WILDs.  This will be updated
       each release.

131    In .SCWLD, if the input and output files are for  the
       same  owner,  set  the  default  protection to be xyy
       where x is from the system standard  file  protection
       and yy is from the input file.

132    Support the DATE75 project when checking the  /BEFORE
       and /SINCE switches.

133    Support the /OKPROTECTION and /ERPROTECTION switches.
       /OKPROTECTION   suppresses   protection  check  error
       messages.  This is the default if the UFD is wild.

134    Correct error in edit 127.

135    Handle device NUL: correctly.  NUL: is considered  to
       be a non-directory device for callers of WILD.

136    (SPR 10-10819) Fix a bug  in  the  DECtape  directory
       logic  for  wild-carding which omitted the first file
       of the directory.

137    Type  the  correct  directory  when  the  UFD  has  a
       protection  error  and the user was trying to specify
       the directory itself.

140    Change all error messages to have a unique prefix  of
       six  letters starting with WLD.  The message prefixes
       are:
          DEM     %directory is empty
          DFO     ?open failure for xxx in use by job nnn
WILD.DOC -- changes from version 4 to 5               Page 8


          IOE     %error while reading file
          IWC     ?insufficient wild-cards in input for
          output
          LKE      lookup/enter failure (or mnemonic
          message)
          LKP     %lookup failure (or mnemonic message)
          NDO     ?null name in output wild-card
          NFS     ?no file name specified
          NNO     ?null directory in output wild-card
          NSD     %no such directory
          NSF     %no such files as
          NXD     %non-existent ufd
          NXU     %non-existent ufd
          SCO     ?open failure on xxx in use by job nnn
          SLE     %search list empty for device
       Each error message has a local symbol defined of  the
       form E$$xxx where xxx is the unique error suffix.

141    (SPR 10-11421) Verify that /STRS  and  /PHYSICAL  are
       the   same   on   all   files   of   a   concatenated
       specification.

142    Correctly store for the caller  the  pointer  to  the
       matching input file spec.

2.0    CHANGES

100  (INTERNAL) CHANGE TO USE .FX SYMBOLS FROM SCNMAC.

101  USE FX.DFX TO FLAG MFD FIXUPS (USER SPECIFIES EXTENSION
     .UFD).   THIS  GIVES  THE  CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION OF
     FILE  NAME  BEING  IGNORED  AND  DIRECTORY   USED   FOR
     EXTENSION  .UFD.   ALSO,  CORRECT  THE  CODE  TO HANDLE
     SYS:.UFD, ETC., CORRECTLY.

102  REMOVE A  GLITCH  WHICH  PROHIBITED  RE-ENTRY  AFTER  A
     NON-DISK  DEVICE  IS  USED.   BEFORE  THIS  CHANGE, THE
     CALLER HAD TO UPDATE THE INITIAL  POINTER  AND  RESTART
     WILD.

103  ALLOW BOTH FX.ADD  AND  .FXTRO  FOR  THE  INCLUSIVE  OR
     FUNCTION.   THIS  LAYS THE GROUND-WORK TO SWITCH TO "!"
     AS THE INCLUSIVE OR SPECIFICATION  IN  MATCHING  RATHER
     THAT "+".

104  (SPR 10-7182) ADD DEFENSIVE HALT IN CASE  LH(DIRECTORY)
     IS  ZERO.  THIS CAN BE CAUSED ONLY BY AN INTERNAL ERROR
     OR BY A FILSER BUG.

105  (INTERNAL) REPLACE THE INTERN STATEMENTS BY "::".

106  USE THE CORRECT EXTENSION IN THE LOOKUP ERROR MESSAGE.

107  ADD HANDLING OF WILD-CARDS ON  DEC-TAPE.   HANDLING  OF
     NON-DISK  DEVICES  IS  ENABLED  BY  A  NEW  BIT  IN THE
     ARGUMENT BLOCK.  WHEN SET, THE OPEN AND  LOOKUP  BLOCKS
     ARE  SETUP  FOR  ALL  DEVICES.   THE NON-SKIP RETURN IS
     TAKEN ONLY WHEN THE REQUESTS ARE FINISHED.

110  CORRECT SUBSCRIPTING IN E.DFL ROUTINE.

111  FOR  MAG-TAPES,  SET  OPEN  BLOCK  DEPENDING  UPON  THE
     /DENSITY AND /PARITY SWITCHES.

112  CHANGE /BEFORE AND  /SINCE  LOGIC  TO  CONSIDER  -1  AS
     DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR.

113  IF THE USER'S PROJECT NUMBER IS GREATER THAN 7, AND THE
     TARGET  DIRECTORY  PROJECT IS LESS THAN 10, THEN IF THE
     USER TYPED "*" FOR PROJECT AND NOT "*"  FOR  PROGRAMMER
     NUMBER REJECT THE MATCH.  THIS SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT
     FOR  PROJECTS  BELOW  10,  THE  PROGRAMMER  NUMBER   IS
     INDEPENDENT  OF  THOSE  ABOVE  10.  IN PARTICULAR, WITH
     LIBRARIES, ETC., BEING DEVELOPED FOR PROJECTS BELOW 10,
WILD.DOC -- CHANGES FROM VERSION 3 TO 4              Page 10


     USERS  LOOKING  FOR  THEIR FILES IN ALL PROJECTS SHOULD
     NOT SEE THESE FILES.  IF EITHER THE PROJECT IS EXPLICIT
     OR  THE  PROGRAMMER  IS  "*", THEN THE OLD BEHAVIOUR IS
     INDICATED.  THUS, [*,*] WILL STILL  SEARCH  ALL  UFD'S.
     NOTE   THAT  [?,X]  WILL  MATCH  PROGRAMMER  X  IN  ALL
     DIRECTORIES BELOW PROJECT  10.   NOTE  ALSO,  THAT  THE
     BEHAVIOUR FROM [1,2] IS UNAFFECTED.

114  HANDLE  [1,1].UFD  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE   OTHER   .UFD
     HANDLING.     THIS    ELIMINATES    THE   NOTATION   OF
     #X0000YY.UFD[1,1].

115  CORRECT A BUG  IN  THE  MFD  CHKACC  LOGIC.   THIS  WAS
     UNCOVERED  BY  A  BUG IN TWICE WHICH CAUSED STRANGE UFD
     PROTECTIONS, BUT THE CODE SHOULD BE CORRECT ANYWAY.

116  CORRECT BUG INTRODUCED BY 107.

117  ADD  ENTRY  POINT  .CHKTA  FOR  DIRECT  TO  CHECK   THE
     BEFORE/SINCE SWITCHES ON MAGTAPES.

120  CHANGE THE MODULE NAME FROM "WILD" TO ".WILD" TO  AVOID
     ANY NAME CONFLICTS.

121  ADD SYMBOLS ".WILDZ" AND ".WILDL"  FOR  THE  START  AND
     LENGTH OF THE LOW SEGMENT AREA.

122  HANDLE NO MFD MESSAGE GRACEFULLY ("NON-EXISTENT MFD  ON
     XXX:").

2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1 USER (CONSOLE) CHANGES

2.1.1  SUB-FILE  DIRECTORIES  ARE   FULLY   SUPPORTED.    IN
PARTICULAR,  UP  TO FIVE SFDS MAY BE SPECIFIED FOLLOWING THE
PROJECT,PROGRAMMER NUMBER.  THESE SFDS MAY  INCLUDE  BOTH  *
AND  ?   WILD  CARDS.   THE  SFDS  ARE  SPECIFIED  IN SIXBIT
SEPARATED BY COMMAS.  THUS, FOR EXAMPLE,  TO  REFER  TO  THE
FILE  NAMED  FOO.MAC WITHIN SFD XYZ WHICH RESIDES IN SFD ABC
IN AREA [10,612], ONE TYPES "FOO.MAC[10,612,ABC,XYZ]".

2.1.2  THE  DEFAULT  DIRECTORY  SET  BY  SETSRC   IS   FULLY
SUPPORTED.   THIS  IS NORMALLY INVOKED BY NOT SPECIFYING THE
DIRECTORY IN THE COMMAND.  IF IT IS DESIRED TO  SPECIFY  THE
DEFAULT  DIRECTORY  EXPLICITLY,  THE  NOTATION  "[-]" MAY BE
USED.

2.1.3 FOR CONVENIENCE, A DIRECTORY REFERENCE TO A  DIRECTORY
IN  THE  USER'S PROJECT OR HIS PROGRAMMER NUMBER MAY BE LEFT
BLANK.  THUS [,7] WHEN LOGGED IN AS [10,612], MEANS  [10,7].
SIMILARLY, [11,] WOULD MEAN [11,612].  THIS ALSO CAN BE USED
WITH  SFDS,  SO  THE  EXAMPLE  IN  2.1.1  CAN  BE  TYPED  AS
"FOO.MAC[,,ABC,XYZ]".   IF  THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY IS NOT THE
USER'S LOGGED IN UFD, HIS UFD CAN BE  REFERENCED  AS  "[,]".
NOTE  THAT  THESE NOTATIONS USE THE USER'S LOGGED IN PROJECT
PROGRAMMER NUMBER, NOT HIS DEFAULT DIRECTORY.

2.1.4 A  DEFICIENCY  IN  VERSION  1  HAS  BEEN  FIXED.   THE
NOTATION  "+" IS USED TO COMBINE SEVERAL SPECIFICATIONS INTO
ONE WILD CARD SCAN.  IT  REPRESENTS  AN  OR  FUNCTION.   FOR
EXAMPLE,  A.B+C.D  MEANS  ANY  FILE  NAMED  A.B  OR C.D.  IN
VERSION 1, THIS DID NOT WORK FOR  UFDS.   IN  VERSION  2  IT
WORKS FOR ALL CASES.

2.1.5  (SER  1567)  WILD  NOW   HANDLES   CONTROLLER   CLASS
ABBREVIATIONS,   CONTROLLER   ABBREVIATIONS,  AND  STRUCTURE
ABBREVIATIONS.  THIS IS FULLY  COMPATIBLE  WITH  THE  FILSER
INTERPRETATION OF THESE ABBREVIATIONS.

2.1.6 REPORTING OF DIRECTORY LOOKUP ERRORS  IS  DEFERRED  TO
THE  END  OF  LOOKING AT ALL STRUCTURES.  THUS, IF AN SFD OR
UFD IS MISSING ON ONE  STRUCTURE,  BUT  PRESENT  ON  ANOTHER
STRUCTURE,  NO  ERROR WILL BE GENERATED.  THIS IS COMPATIBLE
WITH THE FILSER INTERPRETATION.

2.1.7 THE OPEN FAILURE MESSAGE NOW INCLUDES A QUESTION  MARK
TO  MAKE  IT  FATAL.   IF POSSIBLE, IT ALSO INCLUDES THE JOB
NUMBER OF THE JOB WHICH IS USING THE DEVICE.
WILD.DOC -- CHANGES FROM VERSION 1 TO VERSION 2      Page 13


2.1.8 THE FILSER LOOKUP ERROR CODE 24  IS  SUPPORTED.   THIS
CODE  HAPPENS  IF  THE  JOB'S  SEARCH  LIST  IS EMPTY.  WILD
VERSION 1 DETECTED THIS ITSELF FOR WILD CARD LOOKUPS, BUT IT
DEPENDS ON FILSER IF NO WILD CARDS ARE INDICATED.

2.1.9 THE DIRECTORY WILD CARDING WORKS AS FOLLOWS.   A  FILE
IS  A MATCH ONLY IF IT APPEARS AT THE DEPTH INDICATED BY THE
DIRECTORY SPECIFICATION OR IF  0  MATCHES  THE  NEXT  DEEPER
DIRECTORY   SPECIFICATION.    THUS,   IF   THE   USER  TYPES
"[1,2,A,*,C]", FILES WILL MATCH ONLY  IN  [1,2,A]  (SINCE  0
MATCHES  *)  AND  IN  [1,2,A,*,C]  (SINCE THIS IS THE BOTTOM
LEVEL).

2.1.10 SPECIAL HANDLING IS PERFORMED WHEN THE USER SPECIFIES
.UFD AS THE EXTENSION.  IN THIS CASE, THE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER
NUMBER FROM THE DIRECTORY (AFTER DEFAULTING) IS  SUBSTITUTED
FOR  THE  FILE  NAME  AND THE DIRECTORY IS SET TO BE THE MFD
(1,1).

2.1.11 WHEN THE MONITOR DOES A LOOKUP  ON  DEVICES  SUCH  AS
SYS:  OR HLP:, IT IGNORES THE DIRECTORY SPECIFICATION UNLESS
IT TURNS OUT TO BE A LOGICAL DEVICE  NAME.   WILD  DOES  THE
SAME THING.










2.2 CALLER (PROGRAM) CHANGES

2.2.1 WILD NOW OBSERVES THE  STANDARD  CALLING  CONVENTIONS.
ACS  1-4 ARE TEMP AND 5 IS PRESERVED.  PARAMETERS ARE PASSED
TO IT VIA A POINTER IN AC 1.  THE INDEX TO  THE  SCAN  BLOCK
WHICH  MATCHED  THE REQUEST IS STORED IN A LOCATION SELECTED
BY THE CALLER.

2.2.2 WILD HAS BEEN  UPDATED  TO  USE  THE  REVISED  TYPEOUT
ROUTINES  IN  SCAN VERSION 2.  THE CALLING SEQUENCE TO THESE
ROUTINES HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PASS THE VALUE IN AC 1.

2.2.3 DIRECTORIES ARE LISTED  BY  CALLING  THE  NEW  ROUTINE
(.TDIRB) IN SCAN VERSION 2.  THIS ROUTINE HANDLES SFD FORMAT
AND SCAN FORMAT FOR THE TYPEOUT.

2.2.4 ALL DIRECTORY READING IS NOW ON CHANNEL  0,  WHICH  IS
ASSUMED  TO  BE  A  SCRATCH  CHANNEL.   BECAUSE OF THIS, ALL
DIRECTORIES ARE READ IN DUMP MODE.

2.2.5 THE DATA READ ROUTINE  (.NXDTW)  NOW  USES  A  CHANNEL
SELECTED  BY  THE  CALLING PROGRAM.  THE DATA CHANNEL IS NOW
OPENED BY THE CALLER.

2.2.6  THE  FLAG  (.WLDFL)  WHICH  INDICATES  WILDCARD   VS.
MULTIPLE  STRS  VS.  SIMPLE LOOKUP, NOW HAS A FOURTH STATE--
VALUE -2 MEANS BOTH MULTIPLE STRS AND WILDCARD.

2.2.7 THE LOOKUP BLOCK IS  NOW  RETURNED  IN  A  CORE  BLOCK
POINTED  TO  FROM  THE  ARGUMENT  BLOCK.   THIS  IS SETUP IN
STANDARD EXTENDED LOOKUP FORMAT.

2.2.8 A ROUTINE (.CHKTM) HAS BEEN ADDED WHICH WILL  VALIDATE
THE  FILE'S  CREATION  TIME AND DATE AGAINST THE /BEFORE AND
/SINCE  SWITCHES  FROM  SCAN.   (THESE  SWITCHES   ARE   NOT
SUPPORTED IN SCAN VERSION 2).










5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES

5.1 C.MAC AND  SCNMAC.MAC  ARE  USED  FOR  ALL  MONITOR  AND
PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS.

5.2 ALL DIRECTORY READS ARE VALIDATED  BY  THE  CHKACC  UUO.
THIS REMOVES A DEFICIENCY IN QUEUE WHICH ALLOWED THE USER TO
LIST PROTECTED DIRECTORIES.  THUS WILD CAN NOW  BE  USED  IN
ANY PROGRAM RUNNING WITH JACCT TURNED ON.

5.3 THE INDEX POINTER TO THE FILE SPEC AREA IS NOW IN P1 (AC
5).

5.4 THE DIRECTORY READING CODE HAS BEEN REWRITTEN.   IT  NOW
HANDLES  UFDS AND SFDS IN ONE ROUTINE.  WHEN A UFD OR SFD IS
FOUND, THE SEARCH WILL DROP  DOWN  INTO  THAT  DIRECTORY  IF
THERE  IS ANY POSSIBILITY FOR A MATCH.  AT END OF DIRECTORY,
THE  SEARCH  WILL  RETURN  UP  ONE  LEVEL.   LEVELS  OF  THE
DIRECTORY  WITHOUT  WILDCARDS WILL AVOID THE SCAN AND ASSUME
THE RESULT IMMEDIATELY.

5.5 NO SPRS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.   THE  ONLY  SER  WAS  1567,
WHICH IS ANSWERED.

5.6 WHEN WILD IS DONE WITH A DIRECTORY, IT DOES A CLOSE  100
SO  THE  MONITOR WILL DELETE THE ACCESS TABLES.  THIS SHOULD
DECREASE INTERFERENCE IN THE DORMANT ACCESS TABLES.
