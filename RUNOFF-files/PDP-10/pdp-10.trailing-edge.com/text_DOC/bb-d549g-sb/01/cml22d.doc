COMPIL.DOC -- Changes from V22C(307) to V22D(323)
August 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

Version  22D  is  a  maintenance  release  of  COMPIL.   Version   22D
incorporates  the  fixes made in response to the SPR's received during
this period with improved code and comments.

Version 22D of COMPIL supercedes all previous versions and will run on
all supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

A bug introduced to COMPIL with edit 251 has been eliminated with this
release.   The  /LIST  will  now produce the correct output with COBOL
programs.

Support for COBOL-74 has been added to COMPIL with this release.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs or deficiencies as of May 12, 1978.

COMPIL.DOC -- Changes from V22B(236) to V22C(307)
September 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 22C is a maintenance release of COMPIL.  Version 22C  is  more
reliable  as  it  incorporates  all  fixes  made  in response to SPR's
recieved through July 14, 1976.  In addition, a new  switch  has  been
added.

Version 22C of COMPIL supercedes all previous versions and will run on
all supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Edit Type Commands

In version 22B of COMPIL, if an edit type command was  typed  with  no
argument, and no previous edit type command had been typed, the editor
was simply run.  This is inconsistant with the behavior of  other  CCL
class  commands.   Edit  #273  makes the behavior consistant such that
edit type commands now behave the same as other  CCL  class  commands.
For  example,  if no previous edit type command has been typed and one
types:

     .TECO<CR>

the following error will now be generated:

     ?CMLNPC No previous command

2.2  New Features

The only new feature in COMPIL version  22C,  is  the  /DLIST  or  /DL
switch.  This feature no longer makes a check for spooled or unspooled
users.  With the /LIST (/L) switch, the specific device LPT:  will  be
added  to  the temp core specification.  The /DLIST (/DL) switch won't
specify any device and a disk file will be generated.
CML22C.DOC                                                      Page 6


2.3  FORDDT

FORDDT is now the default debugging aide for FORTRAN.  It is felt that
if  a  product has a specific debugging aide, the DEBUG command should
cause that aide to be loaded with the program rather than regular DDT.
In  the  case of FORTRAN however, many users expressed that they often
preferred to use regular ddt for debugging FORTRAN  programs  and  for
this  reason,  FORTRAN  programs  are loaded with both regular DDT and
FORDDT.  After they are loaded, FORDDT is started.  If the user wishes
to enter regular ddt, typing the command DDT to FORDDT will cause this
to happen.

If the users wants specifically to load a  program  with  a  debugging
aide  other  than the defined debugger, he simply passes the switch to
LINK as follows:

     .LOAD FOO %"DEBUG:XXX"

where XXX is the name of the debugging aide, and FOO is  the  name  of
your program.

2.4  Revision History

release of COMPIL (version 22B, edit 236):

COMPIL.DOC -- Changes from V22A(203) to V22B(236)
August 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

The reasons for this release are to provide support for FORDDT and  to
fix outstanding bugs.

COMPIL version 22B  is  version  22A  with  edits  #204  through  #236
inclusive.   This  version  has no new deficiencies and fully replaces
version 22A.

COMPIL is documented in the  software  notebook  vol.   #1.   Section,
DECsystem-10 OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS



2.0  CHANGES

Edit #

       for COMPIL, LOAD, EXECUTE, DEBUG with no previous command.

205    SPR 12994
       Give an error message if there is nothing to rescan (use RESCAN
       1)

206    SPR 12705
       Extend edit #145 to all  possible  EXITs  except  for  RUN  UUO
       failure.

207    SPR 13072

210    SPR 12259
       Allow TECO comand to be terminated by altmode.

211    SPR 13801
       Fix edit #205 so that error return  is  not  taken  if  DDT  is
       loaded, this is to make debugging easier.

212    SPR 13036
       Put the output extension in a table (if other  than  REL),  use
       the  fifth  argument  to  PROCESS  macro to define it.  This is
       currently only used for MACY11 whose extension is OBJ.

213    DMN
       Give EDR error on MTA operation with no device specified.

214    SPR 12998
       Output /C rather than /T to PIP on TYPE command
CML22B.DOC                                                     Page 12


215    SPR 12993
       Delete code to run UMOUNT and other CUSPs as it is never used.

216    SPR 13000
       Allow MAKE and TECO command with no  previous  command  to  run
       TECO at the normal entry point.

217    TAH
       Turn on SAIL and add SDDT as the debugging  aid  for  SAIL  and
       FAIL

220    TAH
       Fix so that /DEBUG switch to  LINK-10  contains  the  processor
       name.

221    DMN
       Add support for FORDDT this is
       Allow compiler switches of form (debug:(label,index,trace))
       add switch /FORDDT to pass /DEBUG to  all  Fortran  files  that
       need  to  be  recompiled  (but  it  will  not  of  itself cause
       recompilation) and to use FORDDT as the debugging aid.
       add the switch /DEBUG:(ARG LIST) which passes the  same  switch
       and values to the compiler.

222    Spr 11911
       Add the error message
       OFC Only one Fortran compiler allowed ??????  used
       where ??????  is either FORTRAN-10 or F40

230    SPR 13351
       Fix ill mem ref if /MAP given on a COMPILE command

231    SPR 13881
       Give error message IPC Illegal protection code:  xxx
       if not exactly 3 octal characters supplied.

232    SPR 12269
       Backup byte count as well as byte ptr in SCANS

233    SPR 12273
       Use "=" rather than "_" where ever possible for .TMP files

234    SPR 11937
       Implement /SAVE and /SSAVE switches to pass current  file  spec
       to LINK-10 as a save switch.  Form is:

            COMPIL A/SAVE,B,C

       which would compile B and C only

235    DMN
       Make switch abreviations /FO, /FOR, /MA and /MAC unique.

235    SPR 10-13963
       Fix edit #174 so that /N is output to LOADER only if required.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

No new bugs or deficiencies are  known  to  have  been  introduced  in
version 22B.  However some longstanding ones have been encountered.

The MAP switch does not like a device but no file name

     e.g.  /MAP:LPT:

will in most cases cause  an  error.   The  problem  is  the  COMPIL's
command  scanner  is  not  smart enough.  Temporary fix, either do not
supply any arguments to /MAP or always supply a dummy file name.

Several bugs have been found  in  the  handling  of  files  with  null
extensions, all known bugs have been fixed but more could exist.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The installation  guide  is  COMPIL.CTL.   There  are  no  changes  in
installation instructions.
