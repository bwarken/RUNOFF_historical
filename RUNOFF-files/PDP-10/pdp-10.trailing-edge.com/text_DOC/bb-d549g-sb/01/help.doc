HELP.DOC -- Changes from V5(67) to V6(72)
January 1979


1.0  SUMMARY

This version of HELP is faster and  lists  monitor-supported  terminal
types and customer-added commands.

This version fully supersedes all previous versions and runs with  all
versions  of  the  monitor.   It  has no known deficiencies.  It fully
supports the DATE75 project.

HELP is documented in the DECsystem-10 Command Manual and in the  file
HELP.HLP.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1)  Uses TTY width to calculate number of columns of output.

     2)  Types out names of terminals supported by monitor.

     3)  Will type out "negative" (i.e.,  customer-added  as  negative
         entries in appropriate command GETTAB table) commands.

     4)  Is much faster (better sorting algorithm).



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs, deficiencies, or suggestions.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

HELP V6 requires JOBDAT.UNV, MACTEN.UNV, and UUOSYM.UNV.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

70     Faster sorting, use TTY width, type terminal types table.

71     Use .GTIDX table to list customer GETTAB values also.

72     List all six characters of monitor commands.

HELP.DOC -- Changes from V4(54) to V5(67)
June 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of HELP handles sequence numbered files, prints a list of
monitor  TTY  and WATCH commands, and solves all SPRs received through
August 1978 (through 10-2502).

This version fully supersedes all previous versions and runs with  all
versions  of  the  monitor.   It  has no known deficiencies.  It fully
supports the DATE75 project.

HELP is documented in the DECsystem-10 Command Manual and in the  file
HELP.HLP.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

55     (SPR 10-11623) Handle the case of a table with only  one  entry
       which version 4 printed as junk.

56     Remove an extraneous carriage  return  from  page  one  of  the
       source  file which might cause a Q error in some future version
       of MACRO.

57     (SPR 10-9710) Handle (and discard) sequence  numbers  appearing
       in the help files.

60     Add the monitor SET TTY command table list, available  only  in
       5.07/6.01 and subsequent monitors.

61     Add the monitor SET WATCH command table list, available only in
       5.07/6.01 and subsequent monitors.

62     To standardize its command scanning, allow commands of the form
       ".RUN HELP (...)" with the arguments within parentheses.

63     Convert error messages to agree with the error message standard
       by  optionally  prefixing  them  with  "HLP" and a three letter
       message prefix.  Also, on "?" errors, clear the input buffer.

64     Don't print junk characters for new 5 letter  command  and  set
       tables.

65     Change to use UUOSYM.

66     Accept only disk as user's device.

67     Don't type protected help files if not logged in.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Files that are protected so the normal user cannot read them  show  up
in the .HELP * list, but when you try to get HELP on them, you get the
message %HLPNIO no info on "FOO".  Before edit 67,  a  not  logged  in
user  could  see  these  protected files, because his ppn [2,5] is the
same as the HLP:  ppn.  However, now the user gets the message %HLPNIO
no  info  on  "FOO" for protected help files independent of whether or
not they are logged in.



4.0  INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTION

None.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

In HELP *, only list those files which can be LOOKUP-ed by  the  user.
This code was inserted by edit 46 and commented out by edit 52 because
it slowed down HELP significantly.  HELP should remember  the  results
of the LOOKUPs for subsequent passes.

(ARL) Implement a system tutorial for beginners.  This would take  the
form  of  a series of tutorial files presented to the user to lead him
through his first bout with the system step by step.

HELP.DOC -- Changes from V3 to V4(54)
December 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of HELP fully supports device HLP:.  it also handles NEW:
and  OLD:  correctly.  the HELP * command follows the complete list of
help files with  a  list  of  monitor  commands  and  of  monitor  set
commands.

This version fully supersedes all previous versions and runs with  all
versions  of the monitor.  It has been tested under 5.05 and 5.06.  it
has no known deficiencies.

HELP is documented in the DECsystem-10 Command Manual and in the  file
HELP.HLP.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

35     REMOVED SPECIAL TEST FOR ALTMODE (175).

36     CORRECTED ERROR IN PRINTING "ILLEGAL CHARACTER" MESSAGE
       SO THAT CONTROL CHARACTERS WILL BE PREFIXED WITH
       "_^".

37     USE JOBSTS UUO TO DETERMINE IF LOGGED IN.  IF
       JOBSTS FAILS (TINY MONITOR), THEN DO LOGOUT UUO WITHOUT
       MESSAGE FIRST.

40     SKIP REST OF RESCANNED COMMAND ON COMMAND ERRORS.

41     USE DEFAULT NUMBER OF DISK BUFFERS.

42     ALLOW USER TO SPECIFY A DEVICE TO USE IN THE HELP COMMANDS.
       IF SPECIFIED, THAT DEVICE OVERRIDES THE DEFAULT SEARCHING
       (SEE 43).

43     HANDLE HLP:, NEW:, AND OLD:.  WHEN LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC
       FILE, EACH OF HLP:, SYS:, NEW:, AND OLD: ARE TRIED IN THAT
       ORDER.  IF THE USER HAS NEW ENABLED, THEN IT IS SEARCHED
       BEFORE SYS:.  FOR EACH DEVICE, BOTH LOGICAL AND PHYSICAL
       ARE TRIED.

44     ADD MONITOR COMMANDS AND MONITOR SET COMMANDS TO THE HELP *
       OUTPUT.  THESE ARE GETTAB-ED AND SORTED.  (INTERNAL COMMANDS--
       I.E., THOSE PREFIXED "." ARE EXCLUDED.)  EACH LIST IS
       OUTPUT PREFIXED BY A HEADER LINE.
45     FIX BUG WHICH OCCASIONALLY INCLUDED ONE JUNK
       FILE IN HELP *.
HLP4.DOC                                                        Page 7



46     CANCELLED BY 52.

47     HANDLE PHYSICAL UUOS IN HELP * SO THAT THE LIST INCLUDES
       ALL NAMES WHICH CAN BE OUTPUT.  THUS, LOGICAL AND
       PHYSICAL OF EACH OF HLP:, NEW:, SYS:, OLD:, ARE INCLUDED.

50     TRANSLATE COMMON WORDS SUCH AS "ME" AND "US" TO "HELP".

51     CHANGE TO FIT 8 COLUMNS PER LINE INSTEAD OF 6.

52     CANCEL 46

53     MAKE REENTRANT.

54     EXTEND 43 TO HANDLE SYS: CORRECTLY IF USER HAS ENABLED
       FOR NEW. THIS AFFECTS HELP * ONLY.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

HELP.SAV is now HELP.SHR, so delete HELP.SAV from SYS:.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

in HELP *, only list those files which can be lookup-ed by  the  user.
this code was inserted by edit 46 and commented out by edit 52 because
it slowed down HELP significantly.  HELP should remember  the  results
of the lookups for subsequent passes.

The monitor SET WATCH and SET TTY command  argument  lists  should  be
listed  by  HELP *.  This needs them to have gettab tables defined, so
will be postponed until 5.07.

(ARL) implement a system tutorial for beginners.  this would take  the
form  of  a series of tutorial files presented to the user to lead him
through his first bout with the system step by step.
