DIRECT.DOC -- Changes from V4(234) to V5(336)
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release supports the BACKUP project.  It also corrects  all  bugs
reported through SEPT 1975.

DIRECT version 5  runs  on  all  monitors.   It  has  been  tested  on
6.01/5.07.   It  fully supports the DATE-75 project.  DIRECT version 5
fully supersedes all previous versions.

DIRECT version 5 is documented in the system command  manual.   It  is
also  documented  in  the  program  specification DIRECT.RNO.  Related
documentation can be found in the doc files for WILD  version  7A  and
SCAN version 7B.

DIRECT performs a directory listing of any  of  several  media.   Most
commonly,  it  is  used to obtain a directory listing of the disk.  It
can produce a similar listing of a FAILSAFE, BACKUP, or FRS mag  tape.
It  can  also  analyze a tape for the presence of tape labels (both in
ASCII and SIXBIT) as well as SAVE files.  DIRECT can  also  produce  a
listing  of  TMPCOR  and  of DECtapes.  Its output can be formated for
speed, for compactness, for completeness (even extreme detail), or for
sorting by SORT.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

If  /SORT  on  several  file  specs  with  distinct  directories,  the
directories  will  not  be  listed  (even  if  concatenated).  This is
because  of  the  notion  that  distinct  directories   can   not   be
concatenated (in WILD) and that distinct requests to DIRECT (separated
by commas) are treated separately.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile with JOBDAT, C and SCNMAC as universals on UNV:, and Load with
SCAN, HELPER, and WILD on REL:.  For example, change:
     .LOAD U+C,U+SCNMAC,DIRECT,SCAN.REL,WILD.REL,HELPER.REL
to:
     .LOAD DIRECT

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

235    (SPR 10-14,824) Correct an error in the FRS tape format.

236    (SPR 10-14,820) Remove the dot before the extension in /F  mode
       when also requesting /SORT.

237    (SPR 10-14,828) Fix a problem in which  file  constraints  were
       being ignored in /F mode.

240    (SPR 10-14,942) Fix a problem that junk labels were causing  an
       ill.  mem.  ref.

241    (SPR 10-14,972) Fix an incorrect MFS error message  during  FRS
       directories.

242    (SPR 10-14,975) Fix FRS tape error processing  to  prevent  ill
       uuo, etc.

243    (SPR 10-15,399) Fix a bug in FRS handling  which  gave  %DRTJFS
       error for null files.

244    (SPR 10-15,717) Fix  a  bug  causing  all  file  output  to  be
       duplicated on the TTY:  after a prefix-only DRTLKE.

245    (SPR 10-16,555) Fix a bug which caused the subtotals to be  off
       by one file in some cases.  Show units only when /UNITS.

246    (SPR 10-16,552) When /SORT/WIDTH, don't place the directory and
       structure on a separate line.

300    (SPR 10-15,415) Improve edit 243.

301    Fix several bugs in handling BACKUP tapes.

302    Support reworked BACKUP format to  the  level  of  /INTERCHANGE
       mode.

303    Change the assembly proceedure to use .REQUEST.

304    Change symbols of the form F$????  to B$????.

305    Fix bugs in checksums from FRS tapes of files whose  length  is
       4(mod 5) blocks.

306    Support .EXE files.

307    (SER 70-427) Fix a bug that the summary line of two single file
       directories included the name of the second.

310    (QAR 2489) List minor versions Z, AZ, and BZ correctly.

311    (QAR 2990) Speed up processing by letting WILD keep  channel  0
DRT5.DOC                                                        Page 4


       open.   This  requires  changes in WILD version 10 to work, but
       will cause no problem with version 7.

312    On LPT:, don't force out lines.

313    (SER 55-134) Clear initial flags so that the routine TCHR works
       ok during initialization.

314    (SER 70-152) Change "input" to "source" in the  error  messages
       to be less confusing.

315    Add unsupported feature tests around the mag tape code.

316    Extend edit 302 to full support of BACKUP format as written  by
       TOPS-10  including the possibility of files not starting at the
       beginning (as in a continuation tape).

317    Add /COMPARE to  suppress  all  overhead  lines.   This  allows
       simple input to FILCOM.

320    (SER 55-219) Fix /WIDTH to work with all combinations of  input
       switches such as /NORMAL.

321    Remove the wait for line-printer unavailable.  The line printer
       is  now  treated  just  like  any  other  device and if none is
       available, will generate an open failure message.  If  the  old
       behaviour is desired, reassemble with FT$LPW set to 1.

322    Add /INDIRECT to  generate  an  indirect  file  rather  than  a
       directory  listing.   This changes the default output extension
       to be .CCL.  This will allow the file to  be  used  as  command
       input  to  programs which do not themselves support wild-cards.
       In this mode, each file occupies one line without  any  blanks.
       Each file includes its structure and directory explicitly.

323    (QAR 3647) Correct a bug in the print decision if /UNITS.

324    Remove extra blank lines inadvertently inserted by edit 307.

325    Use JOBDAT as a UNIVERSAL file.  Change all externals to be ##.

326    Fix a bug which ignored the directory of the output file.

327    Remove all blank lines on a /SUMMARY.

330    Permit /W for dectapes too.

331    Fix listing of BACKUP format mag-tape with SFD's.

332    (SPR-17317) Search SYS after NEW if ersatz device SYS requested
       and /NEW enabled.

333    Make version checking for .EXE files work.

334    Make [226] work when explicit extension given (or not a disk).

335    Clean up listings under /TITLE (note that the  "SPOOLING"  word
       is not really handled - spaced - correctly yet).

336    Fix /NOPRDEVICE /NOPRDIRECTORY with /INDIRECT.                       _



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Sort capabilities should be built in.

Versions and checksums should be available on DECtapes.

Versions should be available on ASCII files.   One  suggestion  is  to
search  5  lines  into  the  file looking for % followed by a standard
version number.

The title logic and column logic should be expanded to handle DECtapes
and to allow the user more control over the report.

(SPR 10-9943) Add a super grand total to cover an entire mag tape.

(SPR 10-12,805) When labelled  tapes  are  supported  by  the  system,
indicate the actual recorded tape density.

(SPR 10-14,278) Have /ETAIL/SORT format output  on  a  line  per  file
basis, conducive to sorting.

(SPR 10-15,458) Support /SINCE, etc., on DECtapes.

(QAR 2813) On /F/W, put a blank line before and after each  line  with
structure/directory.

DIRECT.DOC -- Changes from V3(152) to V4(234)
September 1974



1.0  SUMMARY This release  supports  the  DATE-75  project.   It  uses
standard  error messages, and cleans up a number of problems.  It adds
the ability to get the author during normal listings,  and  gives  the
user  control  over  the  printing  of the directory and device.  This
version changes the logic so that SFD contents are printed  after  the
entire  owning  directory  instead  of when the SFD is found.  It also
corrects all bugs reported through SPR 10-13,574 (June, 1974).

DIRECT version 4 runs on all monitors.  It has been tested on 5.06 and
6.01/5.07.   It  fully supports the DATE-75 project.  DIRECT version 4
fully supersedes all previous versions.

DIRECT version 4 is documented in the system command  manual.   It  is
also  documented  in  the  program  specification DIRECT.RNO.  Related
documentation can be found in the doc files for  WILD  version  6  and
SCAN version 5.

DIRECT performs a directory listing of any  of  several  media.   Most
commonly,  it  is  used to obtain a directory listing of the disk.  It
can produce a similar listing of a FAILSAFE or FRS mag tape.   It  can
also analyze a tape for the presence of tape labels (both in ASCII and
SIXBIT) as well as SAVE files.  DIRECT can also produce a  listing  of
TMPCOR  and  of  DECtapes.   Its output can be formated for speed, for
compactness, for completeness (even extreme detail), or for sorting by
SORT.

directories  will  not  be  listed  (even  if  concatenated).  This is

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile with C and SCNMAC as universals instead of as parameter files.
For example, change:
     .COMPILE C+SCNMAC+DIRECT
to:
     .COMPILE U+C,U+SCNMAC,DIRECT
where U.MAC contains "%.C==-3".



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

153    (SPR 10-9943) Ensure that the last sub-total is always issued.

154    (SPR 10-10979) Avoid an ILLEGAL UUO message on  some  forms  of
       command errors.

155    (SPR 10-10590) Avoid the spurious (and  incorrect)  message  NO
       FILES on a MTA:/F.

156    Correct bug when creating the buffer ring for magtapes.

157    Cancelled by edit 227.

160    If output is not to  the  TTY:,  force  all  summaries  so  the
       terminal user can see what is happening.

161    (SPR 10-9981) Reject NUL: gracefully.  This test works only  in
       monitors since 6.01/5.07.

162    Support the DATE-75 project.

163    Handle  a   potentially   infinite   number   of   input   file
       specifications.  Actually, the limit is when core runs out.

164    Standardize the error  messages.   Add  prefixes  of  the  form
       DRTxyz.  See the appendix to this document for a list of DIRECT
       error messages.

165    Support   SFD's,   /DENSITY/PARITY,   etc.,   in   the   output
       specification by calling SCAN'S routine, .STOPN.

166    Give the correct message (file name) when there is an I/O error
       on magtape.

167    More of edit 163.

170    More of edit 155.

171    (SPR 10-????) Print the left half of .RBELB in octal, since  it
       is the error CONI.
DRT4.DOC                                                       Page 10


172    When running under 6.01/5.07, use MTCHR. to obtain  information
       in a device (controller) independent fashion.

173    (SPR 10-10324) Add a % at the start of  the  message  FILE  NOT
       FOUND to allow batch jobs to test for this condition.

174    (SPR 10-11580) Add switches to  control  the  printing  of  the
       structure  (device)  and  directory.   The  default remains the
       same, but the structure and/or directory can be  forced  on  by
       the  switches  /PRDEVICE  and  /PRDIRECTORY  respectively.  The
       inverse switches  are  /NOPRDEVICE  and  /NOPRDIRECTORY,  which
       restore  the  default  bahaviour.  Also add the ability to list
       the author in the normal directory listing.  This is controlled
       by the switch /AUTHOR and its default inverse, /NOAUTHOR.

175    Suppress a message which reported a TOTAL OF 0 FILES.

176    More of edit 162.

177    More of edit 173.

200    (SPR 10-11233) In a /DETAIL, compute and print the block number
       (decimal) of the RIB.

201    Count the blocks used on a DECtape listing and issue a  summary
       line like the disk.

202    Suppress the titles on a DECtape or TMPCOR directory listing.

203    Comment out the  code  to  support  BACKUP/RESTORE  format  mag
       tapes.

204    Change assembly proceedure  to  use  C.MAC  and  SCNMAC.MAC  as
       UNIVERSAL files.

205    Print summaries before any  subsequent  error  messages.   This
       also  has  the  benefit  of  issuing  summaries at the end of a
       directory  instead  of  delaying  while   looking   for   other
       directories.

206    Always print UFD names as [p,pn] rather  than  as  normal  file
       names.

207    Use the  new  feature  in  WILD  to  list  the  contents  of  a
       sub-directory after the entire main directory instead of in the
       middle.

210    Support the /MESSAGE level switch and job's setting  via  SCAN.
       This  allows  the  user  to  control  the issuing of the DRTxyz
       prefix  and  the  message  text.   Also  support   the   option
       /MESSAGE:ADDRESS for the ease of debugging.

211    Remove a bug that occasionally  listed  the  directory  on  two
       lines.
DRT4.DOC                                                       Page 11


212    To save typeout time, if /F and not /WIDTH, then  separate  the
       file name and extension with a dot instead of a tab.

213    Support SIXBIT tape labels.

214    (SPR 10-11,493) Force output when at the end of a directory  in
       /F/W mode.  This makes the listing complete sooner, but doesn't
       affect the final result.

215    (SPR 10-12,805) Indicate that  the  density  and  parity  of  a
       magtape  are those that the tape is being read under instead of
       the ones it was written under.

216    (SPR 10-12,995) When a parity error is  encountered  reading  a
       DECtape,  make  the  message  be a warning and proceed with the
       directory listing.

217    Don't force output on a tab.

220    (SPR 10-13,049) Implement /SUMMARY on DECtape and TMPCOR.

221    (SPR 10-13,048) Implement /CHECKSUM, /AUTHOR,  and  /ACCESS  to
       work correctly when /F is specified.

222    On magtape directory listings, exclude the copy of  the  LOOKUP
       block in the checksum;  this will make the totals and subtotals
       agree with the result from the disk.

223    Handle /F/SUMMARY to not include "0 blocks".  In this case, the
       summary  message  will  now  be  "total of n files".  Normally,
       however, /F/SUMMARY will include the block count  since  it  is
       specifically accumulated.

224    Fix miscellaneous bugs introduced since version 3.

225    Add switch /FDTA and /NOFDTA to complement it  which  indicates
       that  the  DECtape  directory is to be read quickly (from core)
       instead of from the tape each time.

226    (QAR 2173) Allow output of a  DECtape  directory  to  the  tape
       whose directory is being taken.

227    Remove edit 157.

230    Support FRS format magnetic tapes.

231    Flag the switches which are global commands since they can  now
       preceed the "@" of an indirect request.

232    Allow SWITCH.INI to specify  file  specific  switches  such  as
       output protection, /PHYSICAL, and /AFTER.

233    Support the WILD version 7 implementation of /OKPROTECTION.  If
       this  is  set  (it is the default if there are any wild-cards),
       then protected files are not listed.  If all matching files are
DRT4.DOC                                                       Page 12


       protected,  then  WILD  issues  the warning message %WLDAFP ALL
       FILES PROTECTED.

234    (Update  of  157  and  227)  Make  the   default   setting   be
       /ERPROTECTION  unless  the user specifies /OKPROTECTION.  Thus,
       protected files and directories will be  listed,  unlike  other
       programs using WILD, which will suppress protected files except
       for a warning if there were any.  Specifying  /OKPROTECTION  if
       there  are  wild cards will give the same results as the normal
       WILD default.  If the WILD default is  really  desired,  DIRECT
       can be reassembled with the unsupported feature test FT$IFP=1.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Sort capabilities should be built in.

Versions and checksums should be available on DECtapes.

Versions should be available on ASCII files.   One  suggestion  is  to
search  5  lines  into  the  file looking for % followed by a standard

indicate the actual recorded tape density.

CORRECTS  ALL  BUGS  REPORTED  THROUGH  SPR 10-8314.  IT ALSO INCLUDES
SEVERAL NEW MAG-TAPE SWITCHES.

DIRECT VERSION 3 RUNS ON ALL MONITORS.  IT HAS BEEN TESTED  ON  5.04A,
AND  5.05.   DIRECT  VERSION 3 FULLY SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS.
IT ALSO FULLY SUPERSEDES LOOKFL.

DIRECT VERSION 3 IS DOCUMENTED IN THE MAY, 1972, UPDATE TO THE  SYSTEM
COMMAND  MANUAL.   IT  IS ALSO DOCUMENTED IN THE PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
DIRECT.RNO.  RELATED DOCUMENTATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE DOC  FILES  FOR
WILD VERSION 4 AND SCAN VERSION 3.

BEWARE OF THE FOLLOWING FORMAT CHANGES IN /SORT  OUTPUT.   DIRECTORIES
ARE  NOW  INCLUDED IF A WILD-CARD IS SPECIFIED IN THE DIRECTORY (126).
THEY ARE  LISTED  IN  FIXED  FORMAT  (137).   THE  VERSION  COLUMN  IS
ALLOCATED  15  CHARACTERS,  PUSHING THE STRUCTURE AND DIRECTORY FIELDS
ONE TAB TO THE RIGHT (8 COLUMNS) (150).  ON MAGTAPES, THE STRUCTURE IS
ALWAYS INCLUDED (151).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

NONE.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES.

IF  /SORT  ON  SEVERAL  FILE  SPECS  WITH  DISTINCT  DIRECTORIES,  THE
DIRECTORIES  WILL  NOT  BE  LISTED  (EVEN  IF  CONCATENATED).  THIS IS
BECAUSE  OF  THE  NOTION  THAT  DISTINCT  DIRECTORIES   CAN   NOT   BE
CONCATENATED (IN WILD) AND THAT DISTINCT REQUESTS TO DIRECT (SEPARATED
BY COMMAS) ARE TREATED SEPARATELY.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

NONE.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

126  (SPR 10-7613) LIST DIRECTORIES IF WILD  DIRECTORY  AND  /SORT  IS
     SPECIFIED.

127  (INTERNAL) CHANGES  STORAGE  LOCATION  OF  SOME  SWITCHES  TO  BE
     COMPATABLE WITH THE OPTIONS FILE CALL.

130  CALL .OSCAN TO IMPLEMENT THE USER PROFILE "SWITCH.INI".  ALSO ADD
     SWITCH /NORMAL (OR /N) TO OVERRIDE A /FAST IN THE PROFILE.

131  (SPR 10-8314) THE SUMMARY OF LOOKUP ERRORS WAS  PREMATURE.   THIS
     HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

132  (SPR  10-8280)  GRAND  TOTAL  CHECKSUMS  WERE   INCORRECT   (THEY
     DUPLICATED THE LAST FILE).  THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

133  (QAR 149) MAG TAPE SCANNING STOPPED ON THREE RATHER THAN TWO TAPE
     MARKS.  THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

134  (SPR 10-7635) DIRECTORY OF A /U FAILSAFE TAPE PUT THE SUMMARY  IN
     THE WRONG POSITION (DELAYED).  IT ALSO SKIPPED SOME SUMMARY LINES
     FOR THE SAME REASON.  THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

135  MAG  TAPE  DIRECTORIES  DID  NOT  HANDLE   EMPTY   CROSS-SECTIONS
     CORRECTLY.  THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

136  THE RIB WORD (EXTENDED LOOKUP BLOCK) CONTAINING THE CREATION DATE
     AND TIME IN INTERNAL FORMAT IS NOW PRINTED IN HUMAN TERMS (RATHER
     THAN OCTAL).

137  (SPR 10-7613 SUGGESTION) IN /SORT MODE, THE DIRECTORIES ARE GIVEN
     WITH  LEADING  ZEROS  (OR  TRAILING SPACES) TO ALLOW SORTS ON THE
     DIRECTORY FIELD.

140  CORRECTED A FORMATTING BUG IN FIXED FORMAT OCTAL (7).

141  (QAR 177 SUGGESTION) ADDED SWITCHES TO CONTROL REWINDS, NUMBER OF
     TAPE  MARKS  TO PROCESS, AND WHETHER TO STOP AT DOUBLE MARK.  THE
     NEW SWITCHES ARE:
     /EOT AND /NOEOT TO CONTROL DOUBLE MARK.
     /FILES:N TO CONTROL NUMBER OF MARKS.
     /REWIND AND /NOREWIND TO CONTROL THE REWINDS.
     AT THE SAME TIME, ADDITIONAL SWITCHES TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING ONES
     WERE INCLUDED:
     /BLOCKS AS OPPOSITE OF /WORDS
     /WRITTEN AS OPPOSITE OF /ALLOCATED
     /NO FOLLOWED BY CHECKSUM, SORT, OR TITLE

142  CHANGE /MARKS OUTPUT TO INDICATE THE FINAL TAPE MARK AS WELL.

143  CORRECT BUG INTRODUCED BY 127.

144  CORRECT BUG INTRODUCED BY 140.

145  RESTORE .JBFF BEFORE EACH OPEN.   THIS  PREVENTS  AN  UNNECESSARY
     GROWTH  IN  SIZE.   ALSO,  ON  DISK  FILES,  DO  AN INBUF 10.  TO
     ESTABLISH A LARGE RING IN CASE OF CHECKSUMMING.

146  ADD /NOSUMMARY, /NODETAIL, AND /NOUNITS TO CANCEL POSSIBLE OPTION
     SETTINGS.

147  IF /DETAIL/SUMMARY, DO  BOTH.   IF  /NOSUMMARY,  NEVER  GIVE  THE
     SUMMARY.   IF /NOUNITS, ALWAYS GIVE THE STRUCTURE (PREVIOUSLY, IF
     THERE WAS NO WILD-CARDING, THE UNIT  WAS  GIVEN;   ALSO,  /DETAIL
     WILL DEFAULT TO /UNITS BUT OBSERVE THE ACTUAL SETTING IF GIVEN).

150  IF /SORT, ALLOCATE 15 COLUMNS  FOR  THE  VERSION  NUMBER  SO  THE
     STRUCTURE AND DIRECTORY ARE IN FIXED POSITIONS.

151  ON MAGTAPES, /SORT WILL ALWAYS INCLUDE THE STRUCTURE SINCE  THERE
     IS  NO  WAY  TO TELL WHETHER THE TAPE REPRESENTS ONE OR MORE FILE
     STURUCTURES.

152  (DEFICIENCY OF VERSION 2)  IF  /SUMMARY,  INCLUDE  VIRTUALLY  ALL
     SUMMARIES  INCLUDING  THOSE  OF  ONE FILE, ETC.  THE ONLY SUMMARY
     OMITTED IS NO FILES AND NO ERRORS ON ONE STRUCTURE.  EVEN IN THIS
     CASE, THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE LISTED (0 FILES).



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

SORT CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE BUILT IN.

CONSTRAINTS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FIELDS BESIDES CREATION  DATE/TIME
AND FILE NAME/EXT/DIRECTORY.

VERSIONS AND CHECKSUMS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON DECTAPES.

VERSIONS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ASCII FILES.   ONE  SUGGESTION  IS  TO
SEARCH  5  LINES  INTO  THE  FILE LOOKING FOR % FOLLOWED BY A STANDARD
VERSION NUMBER.

AN OPTION SHOULD EXIST TO TYPEOUT THE NAME AND EXTENSION IN OCTAL  FOR
CONVENIENCE OF OCTAL TYPEIN.

THE TITLE LOGIC AND COLUMN LOGIC SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO HANDLE DECTAPES
AND TO ALLOW THE USER MORE CONTROL OVER THE REPORT.

MORE THAN 16 INPUT SPECS SHOULD BE ALLOWED.   THE  DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION
TECHNIQUE IN QUEUE SHOULD BE ADOPTED.

DIRECT.DOC -- CHANGES FROM VERSION 1 TO 2
APRIL 1972



1.0 SUMMARY

THIS RELEASE UPGRADES DIRECT TO USE SCAN VERSION 2 AND WILD VERSION 2.
DIRECT  ALSO  SUPPORTS  SUB-FILE DIRECTORIES AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE
5.05 MONITOR.  THIS VERSION OF DIRECT ALSO READS MAGTAPES IN  FAILSAFE
AND BACKUP FORMATS.

DIRECT VERSION 2 RUNS ON ALL MONITORS.  IT HAS BEEN  TESTED  ON  5.03,
5.04,  AND  5.05.   DIRECT  VERSION  2  FULLY  SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS
VERSIONS.  IT ALSO FULLY SUPERSEDES LOOKFL.

DIRECT VERSION 2 IS DOCUMENTED IN THE MAY, 1972, UPDATE TO THE  SYSTEM
COMMAND  MANUAL.   IT  IS ALSO DOCUMENTED IN THE PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
DIRECT.RNO.  RELATED DOCUMENTATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE DOC  FILES  FOR
WILD VERSION 2 AND SCAN VERSION 2.



2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1 DIRECT VERSION 2 USES  SCAN  RATHER  THAN  THE  BUILT  IN  COMMAND
SCANNER.   THIS  GIVES  DIRECT  THE  STANDARD  INDIRECT  FILE  AND CCL
CAPABILITIES.  IT ALSO SUPPORTS ALL STANDARD SWITCHES SUCH AS /RUN.

2.2 SUB FILE DIRECTORIES ARE FULLY SUPPORTED.  SEE SCAN AND  WILD  DOC
FILES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

2.3 THE TOTAL LINE NOW INCLUDES THE NUMBER  OF  LOOKUP  FAILURES.   IN
/CHECKSUM MODE, IT ALSO INCLUDES THE AGGRAGATE CHECKSUM.

2.4 IN /SORT MODE,  THE  DATES  ARE  GIVEN  IN  ANSI  STANDARD  FORMAT
"YYYYMMDD" SO THAT THEY CAN BE SORT KEYS.

2.5 THE DIRECTORY IS  LISTED  IN  /SORT  MODE  ONLY  IF  THERE  WAS  A
DIRECTORY WILDCARD.

2.6 THE STRUCTURE IS LISTED IN /SORT MODE ONLY IF MULTIPLE  STRUCTURES
ARE INDICATED.

2.7 IN /WIDTH, THE STRUCTURE AND DIRECTORY ARE LISTED  ON  A  SEPARATE
LINE.

2.8 THE VERSION IS NOW OUTPUT BEFORE THE STRUCTURE AND DIRECTORY.

2.9 THE SPOOLED FILE NAME IS NOW INCLUDED IN  THE  NORMAL  LISTING  IF
NON-ZERO.

2.10 /FAST AND /SUM MAY BE USED  TOGETHER.   THIS  WILL  GIVE  A  FAST
LISTING AND THE FULL SUMMARY.
DRT2.DOC                                                       Page 19


2.11 DIRECT WILL  NOW  GIVE  SUBTOTALS  FOR  EACH  DIRECTORY  ON  EACH
STRUCTURE.

2.12 THERE IS A NEW SWITCH, /WORDS, WHICH WILL PRINT DISK  LENGTHS  IN
WORDS INSTEAD OF BLOCKS.

2.13 THERE IS A NEW SWITCH,  /DETAIL,  WHICH  INCLUDES  EVERYTHING  OF
INTEREST  FROM  THE  EXTENDED  LOOKUP.   THUS,  DIRECT VERSION 2 FULLY
SUPERSEDES LOOKFL.  THE ONE SYNTAX CHANGE FROM LOOKFL IS THE METHOD OF
LISTING THE UFD LOOKUP INFORMATION.  WHEREAS IN LOOKFL, ONE WOULD TYPE
"15,73.UFD", IN DIRECT ONE TYPES "[15,73].UFD".  DIRECT ALSO  SUPPORTS
WILDCARDS IN THIS MODE.

2.14 THE TMPCOR DIRECTORY LISTING NOW INCLUDES THE FREE SPACE FOR THIS
JOB.

2.15 THE + NOTATION IS NOW SUPPORTED ON ALL DEVICES CORRECTLY.

2.16 THE RIB VERSION NUMBER (.RBVER) IS NOW  USED  IF  AVAILABLE.   IN
/DETAIL MODE, BOTH FILE AND RIB VERSIONS WILL BE LISTED IF DIFFERENT.

2.17 "UFD" IS NOT LISTED FOR UFDS.  THE UFDS ARE COMMA CENTERED.  THIS
MAKES THE UFD LISTINGS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NORMAL ONES.

2.18 IF THE INPUT DEVICE IS A MAG TAPE, PROCESS IT IN ITS ENTIRETY  IN
HRI,  SAVE,  FAILSAFE,  AND  BACKUP FORMATS.  ANSI-LIKE LABELS WILL BE
PRINTED.  IF /MARKS IS TYPED, ALL TAPE MARKS (EOFS) WILL BE INDICATED.
THE  TAPE DENSITY AND NUMBER OF CHANNELS WILL BE LISTED.  FOR FAILSAFE
AND BACKUP FORMATS, THE MAG TAPE DIRECTORY WILL BE JUST LIKE THE  DISK
DIRECTORY THAT IT BACKS UP.  THIS INCLUDES /CHECKSUM AND /DETAIL.  THE
STANDARD SWITCHES /DENSITY AND /PARITY  ARE  SUPPORTED.   THE  DEFAULT
DIRECTORY ON MAG TAPE IS [*,*,*...*], NOT [-].

2.19 THE STANDARD SWITCH /PROTECT IS SUPPORTED ON OUTPUT.



3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES.

THE 5.05 PSEUDO-DEVICES OF HLP:, SXS:, ALL:, ETC.  HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY
CHECKED  OUT BECAUSE THE 5.05 MONITOR TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE.  BACKUP
FORMAT HANDLING IS STILL TENTATIVE.  IT WILL BE REVISED WHEN BACKUP IS
RELEASED.

IF ONLY ONE FILE IS BEING LISTED AND /SUMMARY IS  REQUESTED,  THEN  NO
OUTPUT IS GENERATED.  THIS IS BECAUSE NORMAL LISTINGS DO NOT INCLUDE A
TOTAL LINE IN THIS CASE.



4.0 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DIRECT NOW ASSEMBLES WITH C.MAC AND SCNMAC.MAC.   IT  IS  LOADED  WITH
SCAN.REL, WILD.REL, AND HELPER.REL.
DRT2.DOC                                                       Page 20


5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES

5.1 AFTER LOOKUPS, A CLOSE 100 IS ISSUED TO DELETE THE ACCESS  TABLES.
THIS SHOULD HELP THE FILSER OPTIMIZATION.

5.2 THE FOLLOWING SPR FIXES HAVE BEEN  INCORPORATED:   10-4872,  4598,
6005, 6279, AND 6368.  THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING SPRS.

5.3 (SPR 10-6368) IN /SORT MODE,  ALL  TABS  ARE  PREFIXED  BY  ENOUGH
SPACES  TO MAKE THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS UNIFORM.  THUS ANY COLUMN CAN
BE USED AS A SORT KEY.

5.4 DTA:  DIRECTORY NOW USES 317 MODE.  THIS ALLOWS DEAD RECONING.  IN
5.04  AND  LATER MONITORS, THE TAPE IS NOT PRE-POSITIONED TO BLOCK 98.
INSTEAD, DIRECT COUNTS ON THE MONITOR SWAPPING THE JOB AS NEEDED.

5.5 A BUG WHICH RESULTED IN ERRONEOUS NON-EXISTENT FILE  MESSAGES  HAS
BEEN CORRECTED.

5.6 THE /BEFORE AND /SINCE SWITCHES WILL BE SUPPORTED  WHEN  INSTALLED
IN SCAN.  THE SPACE IS ALLOCATED AND THE CALL TO WILD IS PRESENT.

5.7 THE TYPE/LIST LOGIC AND TITLE LOGIC HAS BEEN  CORRECTED  TO  AVOID
SEVERAL INSTANCES OF DOUBLE OUTPUT.

5.8 TABS AT END OF LINE ARE NOW CORRECTLY SUPRESSED.



6.0 SUGGESTIONS

6.1 SORT CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE BUILT IN.

6.2 CONSTRAINTS  SHOULD  BE  AVAILABLE  FOR  FIELDS  BESIDES  CREATION
DATE/TIME AND FILE NAME/EXT/DIRECTORY.

6.3 VERSIONS AND CHECKSUMS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON DECTAPES.

6.4 VERSIONS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ASCII FILES.  ONE SUGGESTION IS TO
SEARCH  5  LINES  INTO  THE  FILE LOOKING FOR % FOLLOWED BY A STANDARD
VERSION NUMBER.

6.5 AN OPTION SHOULD EXIST TO TYPEOUT THE NAME AND EXTENSION IN  OCTAL
FOR CONVENIENCE OF OCTAL TYPEIN.

6.6 THE TITLE LOGIC AND COLUMN LOGIC  SHOULD  BE  EXPANDED  TO  HANDLE
DECTAPES AND TO ALLOW THE USER MORE CONTROL OVER THE REPORT.

6.7  MORE  THAN  16  INPUT  SPECS  SHOULD  BE  ALLOWED.   THE  DYNAMIC
ALLOCATION TECHNIQUE IN QUEUE SHOULD BE ALLOWED.
